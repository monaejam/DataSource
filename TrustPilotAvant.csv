The divorce was brutal leaving me, among other things, in financial ruin. It’s been over 5 years and I have built a nice life for me and my kids. The only thing that still plagued me was my credit. Credit that my ex destroyed. (I know, I know. Poor me)

I’m in a better situation now with a good job. I pay my bills, taxes, etc. yet no company would give me a chance to prove I can be trusted again with a line of credit.
Holidays, bdays became much more..limited. Vacations were non existent. And random emergencies were simply not allowed!

"Avant","false","","2024-03-05T19:38:21.000Z","TL;DR: Questionable applications opened & poor customer service. Transparency is the issue.


I was offered a 2% rewards card if I applied and opened a new account with Avant through Credit Karma. I did as told. I discovered that two applications were opened when I applied in February 2024.

This concerned me; so,I emailed Avant support asking if the card I was approved for was still a rewards card. (I hadn’t received anything in the mail yet.) I was told to call. I did. I was told that it was in fact the rewards card. I also was told via email that I would receive a separate email verifying the rewards portion. I never did. I tried emailing again and received another ‘call support’ response. So I did. Then the system was down; no help again.

I decided to make an approximate $15 purchase to see if any rewards would generate. Nothing. I called again today (05March2024) and was told that it wasn’t a rewards card and that I can’t have two cards. I tried to explain that I only applied for the one. I was given a scripted response. I asked for a supervisor. I was told one wasn’t available and to request a callback when one was. I then closed my account.

I will not work with a company that cannot provide a straight answer; especially when it appears that two applications were opened at once without my consent. If you never have to ask for support, this card will be ideal.

Please improve communication.","3","Credit Card Bait & Switch","https://trustpilot.com/reviews/65e7588dad64ca7a65083b16","Ted"

Changing terms to 10% origination fee or $999 and only depositing $9001 into account. This dramatically changed the terms to a loan that was a very very very bad deal and I never would have accepted.

I got the new information about loan how much from what account and it never gave me a due date. I thought the new amount would be deducted the same day that it has been deducted for the previous six months. I went to store and looked like a total fool when my account was 480 dollars in the hole. I looked and seen Avant had moved my due date to the 20th and pulled the money two days earlier. When I called Avant the lady rudely informed me that the due date last month was the 20th and the 20th of this month. Zero Empathy. She ewas an ass and said it would be on the new agreement. I went back through my emails and Avant on December 19th, 2023 sent me an email outlining everything.
The current balance, the additional funds, the admin fee, the new total, and the funding date. Nothing about a new due date. I am a simple person, I wish that if you were going to make changes to my automatic payment it would have been pre-approved and not done without my knowledge. Also why would you change the due date that had been previously set for half a year before. Frustrated to be in the hole for two days before payday! I know Avant doesn't give a care, pass on the blame to me, even though I have been making this payment on the 22nd for six prior months. You don't care because you aren't having to not feed your family for two days.

I then made another $100.00 payment (online) and called customer (lousy) service. As soon as someone picked up the phone the first thing I heard was my MIRANDA RIGHTS that this is attempt to collect a debt...(wait - what debt?) tolld them I had made the payment on 1/10 and another one on 2/14. They said the payment on 1/10 went to my balance and they have no record of the 2/14 payment (yet) though my back said it was already pending. explained the problem and said there is nothing they could do about the 1/10 payment because it had been made (24 HRS) to soon...WAIT WHAT?. and the the late charge will stand and that there is nothing they could do about it. Asked to talk to a supervisor, only to placed on hold for over 25 min and nothing. I have emailed them multiple times and after 2 days nothing. Told to cancel the card and would just pay if off, but that I would NOT pay either the late charge nor the annual fee since the card would not be used in the coming year. If you have a problem with them, customer service is NO help at all and emailing them is just as bad.

Please be advised that a soft credit inquiry will not affect your credit score and is not visible to other creditors. However, upon submission of your application for final review, each customer is required to acknowledge and consent to a hard credit inquiry. Note that rates are determined on an individual basis and are based on a number of factors including your credit score and repayment history, among others. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact us at Support@Avant.com and we will promptly address your concerns.","2024-03-06T23:11:04.000Z","During the application process I was required to submit my banking account information login to them through a third party.

Absolutely NOT! Now my application is unfinished and my credit score negatively impacted for no reason.

Avant says applying won’t affect your credit score. False. I received a hard inquiry and my score dropped five points.


Avant’s reply states a soft inquiry won’t affect my score. Sure.

But I got a hard inquiry because you denied my application because I refused to give a third party my bank account sign in information.

That was never listed as a requirement.
I would never in this day and age provide my online banking access to a credit card company or any company.

This is completely unacceptable business practices, Avant is predatory and dishonest. I should have trusted the negative reviews.

Even Avant’s reply is deceptive.
I received a hard inquiry.
Yet notice their reply starts off with a completely useless fact that doesn’t apply to this situation, obviously in an attempt to negate my factual experience.

I just double checked, and there is a hard inquiry… Please contact credit bureau and remove the inquiry Avant.

When filling out the account information, I put down my permanent address. I was expecting to be able to add a different PO Box mailing address later on, as I live in a town that only uses PO Boxes and does not offer street deliveries for mail.

I sent an email to ask for my mailing address to be updated. I was told this is against the policy they have for addresses (PO Boxes are not allowed to be set as an address on your account).

I sent another email explaining I just wanted to update my mailing address, not my physical address. I was told to call in to speak with someone.

I called in and was told having the credit card mailed to my PO Box is not possible. I asked to speak to a manager at least three times; I was ignored and was told repeatedly what I wanted was not possible. I finally gave up and told them to close my account. They proceeded to close my account, and I asked again to speak to a manager. After an almost 10-minute hold, I am informed the manager is ""on a call"" and they can leave a message.

However, the experience turned into a nightmare from the very beginning. After receiving the card, I attempted to activate it, but it wouldn't work. Despite multiple attempts through the online portal and calls to customer service, the issue remained unresolved.

Customer service was unhelpful and unresponsive. After waiting on hold for extended periods, I finally reached a representative who failed to activate the card and couldn't explain the problem. Frustrated and unable to use the card, I decided to cancel it.

To my shock and dismay, the representative informed me that I was still responsible for the annual fee, even though the card never worked. They refused to waive the fee or offer any form of compensation for the inconvenience and time wasted.

When I requested to speak to a manager, I was astonishingly told that they didn't have one available. This lack of accountability and escalation options further highlighted the company's unprofessionalism and disregard for customer concerns.

Avoid AvantCard at all costs! Their non-functional card, poor customer service, hidden fees, and lack of accountability make them a terrible choice for anyone seeking a credit card. Be wary of their misleading offers and save yourself the frustration and financial hassle I experienced.","1","Title: Beware of AvantCard: Unresponsive Customer Service and Hidden Fees","https://trustpilot.com/reviews/65aecaeca7e51aa518bf8dd3","Neel Larson"

So good luck catching fraud. I called to check my balance before I made a transaction and it's not accurate. I called to see why my account was showing negative and no one could tell me any transactions or see anything on my account to even help me. The first representative told me they don't post the over balance to the credit bureau and that it wasn't going to hurt my credit. Same morning they reported to the credit bureau and I lost a ton of points. I called back to see what happened and they still can't see anything on my account. I asked them to remove it from my report. The lady says she needs to get a supervisor but none are available. Then asks when someone can call me back . I said today asap. And then the lady says remember you can log into your account online to check on your information - but you literally can't and that was part of the reason I called. Literally the worst credit card I've ever had. I wouldn't recommend to anyone. For a company that's supposedly giving credit cards to help build credit it seems highly negligent to not allow the card holder accurate and up to date information on their account and balances. Up to 10 days to post to your account - really!?

We'd love a chance to fix this situation.","2024-01-18T16:52:12.000Z","This review to express my dissatisfaction, with the customer service provided by Avant Money. My recent experience in trying to pay off a loan has been incredibly frustrating. I feel it's important to share my concerns.

I started the loan repayment process seven weeks ago. Despite my efforts I'm still waiting for a confirmation letter in the mail confirming that the loan has been fully paid off. This delay is not just inconvenient. Also has implications for my mortgage application, which is now being unnecessarily delayed.

I've called Avant Money times over the seven weeks to inquire about the status of the letter. Unfortunately, every time I call they inform me that the letter is ""on its way."" The lack of a resolution and constant delays in receiving the documentation are causing me a lot of distress and inconvenience.

In an attempt to escalate this matter I requested a callback, from a manager. To my disappointment they informed me that it would take 48 hours for this process. Unfortunately, I still haven't received any callback yet further prolonging the resolution of this issue and adding to my frustration.
The customer service team, at Avant Money is incredibly inefficient and unresponsive which is completely unacceptable. This does not affect my commitments but also specifically impacts my mortgage application.

I strongly urge Avant Money to address this problem and find a solution to the delays in providing the paperwork. This experience has not damaged my perception of Avant Money. Has also raised concerns about the dependability and effectiveness of their customer service procedures.

I sincerely hope that my feedback prompts an examination of your customer service practices ensuring that others do not encounter difficulties, in the future.","1","This review to express my…poor custmer service","https://trustpilot.com/reviews/65a93b1c7a100d67b6c2d394","Aislinn bobbett"

I’m getting offers for the same card now on Credit Karma for 2% cashback, instead of 1% cashback that I’m getting now, and supposedly with a higher credit line that I have now, no annual fee, 2% cashback, but the APR is much higher. I’ve had the card for well over a year have had a few credit line increases, but still think my credit line should be much higher than it is, especially since I see what people are getting as a credit line, compared to what I have now after holding the card and paying my statement balances in full every month for well over a year. Started at $300 and it’s now at $1000 as of the other day. Feel card should have a credit line of at least $1500 - $2000. Plus, I have a great track record with WebBank! Overall it’s a great card and have recommended it to family & friends who now have the card too.

I've had a large balance on all my credit cards which I have been trying desperately to knock down, with little success. I received an offer from AVANT for a personal loan to pay my credit card debt. Although the interest rate is high, it allowed me to pay off all my credit cards and lowered my monthly payments by $400. That gives me much-needed breathing room and I can now pay more than the minimum payment on that loan to pay it off more quickly.

For almost a week, her employees called me at any time they wanted, although I asked to call me at 1pm so that it would not be while I was working in the office. During the call, I can hear almost nothing, since in the background of the conversation of their employee, other conversations and other noises are constantly heard, obviously their company does not know anything about noise reduction. Every day they asked me for more and more information, they even called on Saturday and Sunday. On Sunday during the call, I asked how I could cancel this application, after which the agent still asked questions, she agreed that the additional information she requested was not needed, and said that I would need to check the status of my case in my cabinet and see if it was needed more documents. On Sunday evening I saw that more documents were needed, and on Monday I saw that my application was cancelled. When I called the company and asked why my application was canceled and how to resume it, the agent told me that I canceled my application and if I wanted, I could fill out a new form and that since 7 days had not yet passed, my application would be renewed. When I did this, I received a message that they could not provide me with a loan at this time.

"Avant","true","","2023-10-14T01:54:59.000Z","I was approved for $2000 through a Credit Karma offer with their score of about 660. There were different choices at different times, such as 0%, 1%, 2% and 3% back, since I visit that site frequently. When I saw the 3% populate this last time, I registered for their soft-pull on credit, then finalized it shortly after that approval.

The card arrived promptly and I believe I had some issue activating online, so I used the phone and prompts to do that. I registered my account online and monitor my purchases and payments there. I made multiple purchases nearly immediately at places such as stores and online shopping, even a membership to a social website, as well as my annual phone bill (yep, I pay 1 year in advance); a wide variety of purchases.

In 2 statements, I’ve made 14 purchases and made 5 payments. I am set up for reoccurring automatic payments, but I don’t wait that long. Once you make a payment, if it is over the minimum due for the month, your reoccurring payment is not deducted, because the system knows you have already made that minimum payment, if the minimum is what you are set up to pay. More simply, it does not double dip if you already paid. If you set it to pay your balance, I need not explain that.

The only negative I can think of is that they show your purchases and payments as “pending” for at least a day, so you have to do the math yourself to determine your real balance. I’m used to a credit union where transactions are immediate. Pending means you did it, so I don’t get that.

I have not experienced any problems at all with Avant, and I get 3% back. I’m not addressing others’ problems I’ve read about, because I haven’t had those. They email me about my account, when it is due and when I make a payment. I have replaced my debit card with this card, and I just pay it off as I would have done if I had used a debit card. That is why I make so many payments, and I wanted to make sure they take multiple payments, which they do.

Sometimes I come home from the store and make a payment for what I just bought. This basically cuts my sales tax nearly in half, as long as I pay it off every month. I make at least one payment a week. I’m used to not having a credit card, so that part is a habit to keep. I'll never raise my score if I carry balances on a card, and neither will you.

Don’t ruin your credit again by using this or any card as a luxury. Don’t buy things you couldn’t otherwise pay cash for. Don't tell yourself, ""It's only $19.95"", just don't. Don’t limit your payments to the minimum; pay the entire balance and get used to it. If you must pay a minimum (I get that), pay more no matter how much more. There’s nothing better than looking at your account online and seeing the balance is $0 with a payment due of nothing.","5","My 2-Statement, 5-Payment Review - All Good Here!","https://trustpilot.com/reviews/652989a7042e622a9f53c360","Jon Lioncourt"

"Avant","true","","2023-10-13T17:59:17.000Z","Amazing company! Very fast and reliable. Have used them 2 times and both fully online. I had to pull 1st loan to repair my car. A year later which is now, I applied for more money to consolidate all my debts. Applied on the 5th (thurs) of the month, online, received approval on 6th (Fri) of the month by email, also letting me know I would receive funds on the (Tues) 10th but noticed I received the money in my bank actually on Saturday, the 7th penning, then posted on the 10th. 9th Monday was a holiday. I remember my first loan was pretty fast too. So basically if I didn’t spot over the weekend I’d say from the time you apply it can be 1-4 days. I think my first loan funded by 2nd day and that’s because I had very little debts.

Anyway I was drowning in monthly minimums so this was the best experience because now I just have 1 bill and was able to choose if I wanted long term minimum or short term.

Highly recommend them if you need a loan! Excellent experience. I’ve never had to speak to a customer service rep. I selected autopay and now I’m all set. The 1st bill will be due exactly one month after your fund date, so mine is the 10th every month.

Hope this was helpful, I was shopping around before I applied for my second Loan but felt other companies take too long to approve you online.

If you want a quick turn around which is what I wanted, this company is great!","5","Amazing Loan company!","https://trustpilot.com/reviews/6529695521b578309ec031b3","DS Happy Loan Applicant"

After using the card I called to get my bill/payment information to see when my 1st bill would be due, and was told to call back during business hours. I could not obtain payment info or make a payment outside of their business hours. A few weeks later while paying bills, I realized I was now a few days late on my 1st payment.. I immediately made the payment and asked for a 1 time late payment waive explaining the reason. The representative put it the request and told me I would hear back later with a decision. Days later I received an e-mail letting me know the late fee waive was denied and to call a 1-800 number if I had further questions. I called the 1-800 # and the representative said he couldn’t help with any questions concerning this and directed me to email a separate contact.

The first card was sent to that PO Box but the 2nd card never arrived. Now they tell me Avant can't send a card to my PO Box.

UPDATE: There reply is an example of their ""service"". They have my phone number, so they should call. I ""called"" their phone number and was told they couldn't help me. Hence, the review.

I finally called today and told them to close the account after calling every 2 weeks for 2 months and was told 4 times they were sending out a new card.","1","Horrible business practice","https://trustpilot.com/reviews/650f08756333663e97b88404","Kim Kelley"

After I scheduled the payment a notification came up that said I still need to make my payment due on September 25th. The $300 dollar payment I scheduled today was for my September 25th due date. So I called customer service. AVANT CUSTOMER SERVICE IS A JOKE. I spoke to Auje. It was impossible to make any headway. She just read her printed script no matter what question I ask. She could not provide an answer because she had no clue what she was doing. This is such a reflection on the integrity of a company who has so little regard for the customer that they put little to no effort into ensuring that their employees have the skill set and are equipped with the appropriate knowledge of the product or service they represent to allow them to do their job with even minimal competence. This in no way can be the responsibility of the employee who gets the brunt of our frustration and dissatisfaction, but proof of blatantly self serving leadership. I am the customer.

I googled and found that lots of others have had issues with where they can use the card. Many reported its very limited. It’s relatively easy to get someone on the phone after your card declines, so i guess thats a good thing but the support speech sounds very scripted and leads me to believe they receive these types of calls often.

They replied saying how sorry they were and asked me to call them because they wanted a chance to make things right. I called them and the rep that answered the line had no knowledge of any reply they had sent to me and went further on to say to just disregard the response, because they don't really intend for people to act on the responses when they reply to reviews left by customers, they just reply so it looks good for the company. I asked for a supervisor and of course, none was available. Again, I say this company is a SCAM. They have a lot of hidden and made up fees and never acknowledge their mistakes. They are lairs and I would not encourage anyone to do business with them. I have also contacted the BBB and the news, so hopefully their unlawful practices will be brought to the light soon and the company will be shut down.","1","I would not recommend this company","https://trustpilot.com/reviews/64e3b547f70cc4df4bef7236","Life With Lakiver"

Follow-up review based on creditor's reply: The stated order of events clearly did not transpire as the creditor portrays. The fine line between soft and hard credit report inquiries was not obvious nor clear. Had I been offered this option I would have been aware of it.

Curiously enough, I was directed to Avant through Credit Karma and the follow-up emails from CK indicated they were unaware that my 'pre-approval' application was ever completed. There was a disconnect as to whether I had ever initiated an application let alone completed one.

I stand by my original review and believe Avant is aware of the cloudiness of their 'pre-approval' process.

The plan was selected by the Avant customer service rep. They told me this was what I would have to pay and I would be caught up which I agreed to. I was told my card would stay open and in good standing as well. They also told me there would be interest charges but was not advised that I would also be charged late fees. I was charged for late fees in June, July and August because it was considered late and I didn’t pay enough to cover the past due. How is that when the customer service rep was the one who told me what payment plan would catch me up? I tried calling to get the late fees waived as it was $39/month. The customer service rep was rude and tried yelling at me, was cutting me off and put me on hold for more than 5 mins at a time. Nothing got resolved. I was told they would “file “ a claim for me to get the late fee “refunded” if approved and today I received an email that it was denied.

This is definitely unlawful practice and as I mentioned I was never once warned about late fees. The dates the payments were automatically withdrawn were the dates an Avant rep picked for me stating it would help me get caught up.

I asked to speak to a manager and not one manager came on the phone.

I’d like to speak to someone who can assist and is professional enough to get these late fees cleared up.","1","I set up a payment plan with Avant to…","https://trustpilot.com/reviews/64d79f3f4057010c03da5afc","T Vang"

I don't carry balances, the money I used was in my checking account, therefore I could have used my bank account to pay for the services, that I used the card for. I used the card, because that's what its for. Normally banks report your unpaid balances after both the due date and next statement when you've paid your balance, not the very first statement. If I haven't been given a due date, how can I even pay it.when. You made it seem to credit bureaus I carry a balance, and I don't. This lowered my score 12 points!!!

They told me it could take up to three weeks to have the overpayment deposited into my account. I have a hard time believing this when they make deposits daily.


UPDATE!!!!!!!
I did receive an email today from Avant. It was the same thing they have been telling me that I will receive my refund in 2 - 3 weeks.

I am now on day 5 of trying to get this ""pre-approved"" loan done but they keep making me go through hurdles. I presented all bank states, pay stubs, offer letter, and they pulled my credit with a hard inquiry. But they still can't decide if I should have it so I should talk to the IRS about my income being tracked for 2023. This isn't possible by the way but they insisted that I call the IRS now for prove me wrong. Well it's a holiday weekend so no one is available until Tuesday. They proceeded to state that I won't have a decision then until next Friday at the earliest and berated me on the phone about not knowing how this works.

I had to go over my benefits with her. I had to read it to her and tell her what page it was on. They want your last bank statement, all the pages even if there blank.

I applied for a 2000.00 loan through Avant because it was the 1st options out of 3 on Credit Karma with my credit score being Trans 698 and Equ 700 and Exp 689. EVERY!! document that was required was sent in with the help of 1 of the C.Service Rep.. at the end of the day I was told There was NOTHING else needed from me. But check with my Dash board from time to time just in case. I did that. Nothing was asked if me to submit.I would be notify within 24hrs a decision of Approval or denied. Well i had confidence that I would get approved being Credit Karma BASED these Loan Agencies by my Credit score. Well I called the next day for a follow up and spoke to a Khaleel and by the way she spoke to me I KNEW she had it out for me. I hate to say it but I was treated like she didn’t like the color of my skin. So yes you guessed it I was unfortunately not able to receive the funds lol. So you mean to tell me I can get a card through APPLE.. a Bank that’s great but denied through Avant and their bank of choice. WOW! it said that I have 60 days to submit a form asking what was the decision made to Why I was denied. Yes I WANT THAT FORM. I just want to see what was the reason why I was denied. Be careful with this company.AND Credit Karma at this point I think they are running some kind of scam to get ppls information.

I would send the documents and get a call the next day about one thing or another being wrong (usually they said they couldn't read the document). Once they could make everything out it was an quick and easy process.","3","Good company, difficult to upload documents","https://trustpilot.com/reviews/64583b63734f97e68fad1408","Anna Lauderbaugh"
