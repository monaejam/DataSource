Having bad credit is a struggle and ur stuck with 30% rates which Is very high and punished the poor. I am way more fruggle and didn\u2019t want s loan aber the rates were s\u00f6 good i knew consolidated is what I needed!

One full time job with 2800 euro paid monthly and one partime 160 weekly.I was called by a person from their company asking me if my salary from the part time job is my monthly salary, they already having the last 6 payslips (3 from full time job and 3 from part time job). You will realize how well informed the gentleman who called me was.(this staff is totally beside the point). Was provided the last 6 payslips from both jobs.

Transparency is the issue.\n\n\nI was offered a 2% rewards card if I applied and opened a new account with Avant through Credit Karma. I did as told. I discovered that two applications were opened when I applied in February 2024.\n\nThis concerned me; so,I emailed Avant support asking if the card I was approved for was still a rewards card. (I hadn\u2019t received anything in the mail yet.) I was told to call. I did. I was told that it was in fact the rewards card. I also was told via email that I would receive a separate email verifying the rewards portion. I never did. I tried emailing again and received another \u2018call support\u2019 response. So I did. Then the system was down; no help again.\n\nI decided to make an approximate $15 purchase to see if any rewards would generate. Nothing. I called again today (05March2024) and was told that it wasn\u2019t a rewards card and that I can\u2019t have two cards. I tried to explain that I only applied for the one. I was given a scripted response. I asked for a supervisor. I was told one wasn\u2019t available and to request a callback when one was. I then closed my account.\n\nI will not work with a company that cannot provide a straight answer; especially when it appears that two applications were opened at once without my consent. If you never have to ask for support, this card will be ideal.\n\nPlease improve communication."

I went to store and looked like a total fool when my account was 480 dollars in the hole. I looked and seen Avant had moved my due date to the 20th and pulled the money two days earlier. When I called Avant the lady rudely informed me that the due date last month was the 20th and the 20th of this month. Zero Empathy. She ewas an ass and said it would be on the new agreement. I went back through my emails and Avant on December 19th, 2023 sent me an email outlining everything.\nThe current balance, the additional funds, the admin fee, the new total, and the funding date. Nothing about a new due date. I am a simple person, I wish that if you were going to make changes to my automatic payment it would have been pre-approved and not done without my knowledge. Also why would you change the due date that had been previously set for half a year before. Frustrated to be in the hole for two days before payday! I know Avant doesn't give a care, pass on the blame to me, even though I have been making this payment on the 22nd for six prior months. You don't care because you aren't having to not feed your family for two days. Just pissed about this situation"

Told to cancel the card and would just pay if off, but that I would NOT pay either the late charge nor the annual fee since the card would not be used in the coming year. If you have a problem with them, customer service is NO help at all and emailing them is just as bad.\n\n\nSupplement....\nAfter nearly 3 weeks...Avant finally responded, all it is - is a canned response, no thoughts and still they want you to reach out to them...like I have multiple times already, and all I get is just lip service and no action. Hey AVANT...here's an idea...get off you computer and act like a human and maybe, I don't know...maybe call the customer. you sure expect the customer to do it and do your job."

After receiving the card, I attempted to activate it, but it wouldn't work. Despite multiple attempts through the online portal and calls to customer service, the issue remained unresolved.\n\nCustomer service was unhelpful and unresponsive. After waiting on hold for extended periods, I finally reached a representative who failed to activate the card and couldn't explain the problem. Frustrated and unable to use the card, I decided to cancel it.\n\nTo my shock and dismay, the representative informed me that I was still responsible for the annual fee, even though the card never worked. They refused to waive the fee or offer any form of compensation for the inconvenience and time wasted.\n\nWhen I requested to speak to a manager, I was astonishingly told that they didn't have one available. This lack of accountability and escalation options further highlighted the company's unprofessionalism and disregard for customer concerns.\n\nAvoid AvantCard at all costs! Their non-functional card, poor customer service, hidden fees, and lack of accountability make them a terrible choice for anyone seeking a credit card. Be wary of their misleading offers and save yourself the frustration and financial hassle I experienced."

The first representative told me they don't post the over balance to the credit bureau and that it wasn't going to hurt my credit. Same morning they reported to the credit bureau and I lost a ton of points. I called back to see what happened and they still can't see anything on my account. I asked them to remove it from my report. The lady says she needs to get a supervisor but none are available. Then asks when someone can call me back . I said today asap. And then the lady says remember you can log into your account online to check on your information - but you literally can't and that was part of the reason I called. Literally the worst credit card I've ever had. I wouldn't recommend to anyone. For a company that's supposedly giving credit cards to help build credit it seems highly negligent to not allow the card holder accurate and up to date information on their account and balances. Up to 10 days to post to your account - really!? I recommend people to stay away from this company."

My recent experience in trying to pay off a loan has been incredibly frustrating. I feel it's important to share my concerns.\n\nI started the loan repayment process seven weeks ago. Despite my efforts I'm still waiting for a confirmation letter in the mail confirming that the loan has been fully paid off. This delay is not just inconvenient. Also has implications for my mortgage application, which is now being unnecessarily delayed.\n\nI've called Avant Money times over the seven weeks to inquire about the status of the letter. Unfortunately, every time I call they inform me that the letter is \"on its way.\" The lack of a resolution and constant delays in receiving the documentation are causing me a lot of distress and inconvenience.\n\nIn an attempt to escalate this matter I requested a callback, from a manager. To my disappointment they informed me that it would take 48 hours for this process. Unfortunately, I still haven't received any callback yet further prolonging the resolution of this issue and adding to my frustration.\nThe customer service team, at Avant Money is incredibly inefficient and unresponsive which is completely unacceptable. This does not affect my commitments but also specifically impacts my mortgage application.\n\nI strongly urge Avant Money to address this problem and find a solution to the delays in providing the paperwork. This experience has not damaged my perception of Avant Money. Has also raised concerns about the dependability and effectiveness of their customer service procedures.\n\nI sincerely hope that my feedback prompts an examination of your customer service practices ensuring that others do not encounter difficulties, in the future."

I\u2019ve had the card for well over a year have had a few credit line increases, but still think my credit line should be much higher than it is, especially since I see what people are getting as a credit line, compared to what I have now after holding the card and paying my statement balances in full every month for well over a year. Started at $300 and it\u2019s now at $1000 as of the other day. Feel card should have a credit line of at least $1500 - $2000. Plus, I have a great track record with WebBank! Overall it\u2019s a great card and have recommended it to family & friends who now have the card too. Always have had a great experience, just too low of credit line."

During the call, I can hear almost nothing, since in the background of the conversation of their employee, other conversations and other noises are constantly heard, obviously their company does not know anything about noise reduction. Every day they asked me for more and more information, they even called on Saturday and Sunday. On Sunday during the call, I asked how I could cancel this application, after which the agent still asked questions, she agreed that the additional information she requested was not needed, and said that I would need to check the status of my case in my cabinet and see if it was needed more documents. On Sunday evening I saw that more documents were needed, and on Monday I saw that my application was cancelled. When I called the company and asked why my application was canceled and how to resume it, the agent told me that I canceled my application and if I wanted, I could fill out a new form and that since 7 days had not yet passed, my application would be renewed. When I did this, I received a message that they could not provide me with a loan at this time. Terrible experience with this company!"

        "reviewDescription": "I was approved for $2000 through a Credit Karma offer with their score of about 660. There were different choices at different times, such as 0%, 1%, 2% and 3% back, since I visit that site frequently. When I saw the 3% populate this last time, I registered for their soft-pull on credit, then finalized it shortly after that approval.\n\nThe card arrived promptly and I believe I had some issue activating online, so I used the phone and prompts to do that. I registered my account online and monitor my purchases and payments there. I made multiple purchases nearly immediately at places such as stores and online shopping, even a membership to a social website, as well as my annual phone bill (yep, I pay 1 year in advance); a wide variety of purchases.\n\nIn 2 statements, I\u2019ve made 14 purchases and made 5 payments. I am set up for reoccurring automatic payments, but I don\u2019t wait that long. Once you make a payment, if it is over the minimum due for the month, your reoccurring payment is not deducted, because the system knows you have already made that minimum payment, if the minimum is what you are set up to pay. More simply, it does not double dip if you already paid. If you set it to pay your balance, I need not explain that.\n\nThe only negative I can think of is that they show your purchases and payments as \u201cpending\u201d for at least a day, so you have to do the math yourself to determine your real balance. I\u2019m used to a credit union where transactions are immediate. Pending means you did it, so I don\u2019t get that.\n\nI have not experienced any problems at all with Avant, and I get 3% back. I\u2019m not addressing others\u2019 problems I\u2019ve read about, because I haven\u2019t had those. They email me about my account, when it is due and when I make a payment. I have replaced my debit card with this card, and I just pay it off as I would have done if I had used a debit card. That is why I make so many payments, and I wanted to make sure they take multiple payments, which they do.\n\nSometimes I come home from the store and make a payment for what I just bought. This basically cuts my sales tax nearly in half, as long as I pay it off every month. I make at least one payment a week. I\u2019m used to not having a credit card, so that part is a habit to keep. I'll never raise my score if I carry balances on a card, and neither will you.\n\nDon\u2019t ruin your credit again by using this or any card as a luxury. Don\u2019t buy things you couldn\u2019t otherwise pay cash for. Don't tell yourself, \"It's only $19.95\", just don't. Don\u2019t limit your payments to the minimum; pay the entire balance and get used to it. If you must pay a minimum (I get that), pay more no matter how much more. There\u2019s nothing better than looking at your account online and seeing the balance is $0 with a payment due of nothing."

A year later which is now, I applied for more money to consolidate all my debts. Applied on the 5th (thurs) of the month, online, received approval on 6th (Fri) of the month by email, also letting me know I would receive funds on the (Tues) 10th but noticed I received the money in my bank actually on Saturday, the 7th penning, then posted on the 10th. 9th Monday was a holiday. I remember my first loan was pretty fast too. So basically if I didn\u2019t spot over the weekend I\u2019d say from the time you apply it can be 1-4 days. I think my first loan funded by 2nd day and that\u2019s because I had very little debts.\n\nAnyway I was drowning in monthly minimums so this was the best experience because now I just have 1 bill and was able to choose if I wanted long term minimum or short term.\n\nHighly recommend them if you need a loan! Excellent experience. I\u2019ve never had to speak to a customer service rep. I selected autopay and now I\u2019m all set. The 1st bill will be due exactly one month after your fund date, so mine is the 10th every month.\n\nHope this was helpful, I was shopping around before I applied for my second Loan but felt other companies take too long to approve you online.\n\nIf you want a quick turn around which is what I wanted, this company is great!"

I could not obtain payment info or make a payment outside of their business hours. A few weeks later while paying bills, I realized I was now a few days late on my 1st payment.. I immediately made the payment and asked for a 1 time late payment waive explaining the reason. The representative put it the request and told me I would hear back later with a decision. Days later I received an e-mail letting me know the late fee waive was denied and to call a 1-800 number if I had further questions. I called the 1-800 # and the representative said he couldn\u2019t help with any questions concerning this and directed me to email a separate contact. The run around and hassle to even ask a question has been ridiculous compared to any other card I own."

So I called customer service. AVANT CUSTOMER SERVICE IS A JOKE. I spoke to Auje. It was impossible to make any headway. She just read her printed script no matter what question I ask. She could not provide an answer because she had no clue what she was doing. This is such a reflection on the integrity of a company who has so little regard for the customer that they put little to no effort into ensuring that their employees have the skill set and are equipped with the appropriate knowledge of the product or service they represent to allow them to do their job with even minimal competence. This in no way can be the responsibility of the employee who gets the brunt of our frustration and dissatisfaction, but proof of blatantly self serving leadership. I am the customer. I deserve to be assured of the company's competence, to have trust in and respect for the company I do business with. Mega fail on the part of Avant"

I called them and the rep that answered the line had no knowledge of any reply they had sent to me and went further on to say to just disregard the response, because they don't really intend for people to act on the responses when they reply to reviews left by customers, they just reply so it looks good for the company. I asked for a supervisor and of course, none was available. Again, I say this company is a SCAM. They have a lot of hidden and made up fees and never acknowledge their mistakes. They are lairs and I would not encourage anyone to do business with them. I have also contacted the BBB and the news, so hopefully their unlawful practices will be brought to the light soon and the company will be shut down."

There was a disconnect as to whether I had ever initiated an application let alone completed one.\n\nI stand by my original review and believe Avant is aware of the cloudiness of their 'pre-approval' process. It's a shame they feel they need to resort to this type of marketing in order to attract new clients."

They also told me there would be interest charges but was not advised that I would also be charged late fees. I was charged for late fees in June, July and August because it was considered late and I didn\u2019t pay enough to cover the past due. How is that when the customer service rep was the one who told me what payment plan would catch me up? I tried calling to get the late fees waived as it was $39/month. The customer service rep was rude and tried yelling at me, was cutting me off and put me on hold for more than 5 mins at a time. Nothing got resolved. I was told they would \u201cfile \u201c a claim for me to get the late fee \u201crefunded\u201d if approved and today I received an email that it was denied.\n\nThis is definitely unlawful practice and as I mentioned I was never once warned about late fees. The dates the payments were automatically withdrawn were the dates an Avant rep picked for me stating it would help me get caught up.\n\nI asked to speak to a manager and not one manager came on the phone.\n\nI\u2019d like to speak to someone who can assist and is professional enough to get these late fees cleared up."

I used the card, because that's what its for. Normally banks report your unpaid balances after both the due date and next statement when you've paid your balance, not the very first statement. If I haven't been given a due date, how can I even pay it.when. You made it seem to credit bureaus I carry a balance, and I don't. This lowered my score 12 points!!! Moral of the story wait til your first statement comes out, and you have a due date, before you use this card for any purchases."

They complained that they don\u2019t take responsibility for their employees mistakes and they have to get approval just to remove a fee that they made the mistake of doing. I have paid in full owes training fees and they just accumulate ans this company doesn\u2019t get that it\u2019s the principle not the amount of money which was very insignificant. Thank you very much. I will never recommend a company like yours for anyone not even my worse enemy! Mastercard, capital one all the way .

They told me it could take up to three weeks to have the overpayment deposited into my account. I have a hard time believing this when they make deposits daily.\n\n\nUPDATE!!!!!!!\nI did receive an email today from Avant. It was the same thing they have been telling me that I will receive my refund in 2 - 3 weeks. They really should pay what they owe in a reasonable amount of time. You sure can't pay them late."

We it is now Monday the of the week after I was to be called and still haven't be contacted. I just called again and got customer service who 100% refused to transfer me to the fraud department because no one has yet been assigned my case.

I am now on day 5 of trying to get this \"pre-approved\" loan done but they keep making me go through hurdles. I presented all bank states, pay stubs, offer letter, and they pulled my credit with a hard inquiry. But they still can't decide if I should have it so I should talk to the IRS about my income being tracked for 2023. This isn't possible by the way but they insisted that I call the IRS now for prove me wrong. Well it's a holiday weekend so no one is available until Tuesday. They proceeded to state that I won't have a decision then until next Friday at the earliest and berated me on the phone about not knowing how this works. Ridiculous waste of a hard credit hit for a loan I cancelled due to their bait & switch tactics."

I had to read it to her and tell her what page it was on. They want your last bank statement, all the pages even if there blank. Even tho it took me a week everyone was very nice. If they tell you they have everything they need just check back with them to make sure.

All my credit cards are all high interest so I just paid them off with this small loan at 16.99%. My monthly credit card expense was cut by half and my credit score shot right up!! Seriously...you can't beat it with a stick."

EVERY!! document that was required was sent in with the help of 1 of the C.Service Rep.. at the end of the day I was told There was NOTHING else needed from me. But check with my Dash board from time to time just in case. I did that. Nothing was asked if me to submit.I would be notify within 24hrs a decision of Approval or denied. Well i had confidence that I would get approved being Credit Karma BASED these Loan Agencies by my Credit score. Well I called the next day for a follow up and spoke to a Khaleel and by the way she spoke to me I KNEW she had it out for me. I hate to say it but I was treated like she didn\u2019t like the color of my skin. So yes you guessed it I was unfortunately not able to receive the funds lol. So you mean to tell me I can get a card through APPLE.. a Bank that\u2019s great but denied through Avant and their bank of choice. WOW! it said that I have 60 days to submit a form asking what was the decision made to Why I was denied. Yes I WANT THAT FORM. I just want to see what was the reason why I was denied. Be careful with this company.AND Credit Karma at this point I think they are running some kind of scam to get ppls information. Glad I pay the extra fraud cost on all my credits cause ppl like AVANT just CAN NOT BE TRUSTED!"

After this point I called Avant customer service i paid my balance in full and requested my account to be closed (here comes the funny part) they Accept my payment in (Full) and after they Cleared the payment , they then proceed to ask me what's the reason I'm closing the account and after I gave them the reason they didn't even make an attempt to waive my annual fee for me to stay, which I wasn't going to but this speaks highly of this company Further more they overcharged me in the process of closing my account and now i must wait 2-3 weeks for their mistake .

And after each set of questions I was asked, I was led to believe that my funds would be deposited into my bank account either later that day, or by the next day. It happened 3 different times and I was told to expect funds at least by the next day, three different times! It was like starting over each time I called, checking to see what the holdup was? The customer service team was very pleasant, but there was unnecessary aggravation there as well, due to very thick accents from an off-shore customer service team! As I said before, they were very nice, but they are trained to repeat literally every word that a customer says to them, after each sentence. It\u2019s so annoying and makes communication take twice as long, which is an unnecessary waste of time & causes much aggravation! I actually started thinking that they had lost my original loan application or something because I had to verbally reapply every time I called. I almost canceled and went with another bank because of this, but the last time I called , they assured me that I\u2019d be receiving funds by the next morning, which I did, so no harm done. However there was definitely more aggravation than there had to be. I received a fair rate (for 2023) on my unsecured bill consolidation loan considering the interest rates and market conditions of today! Which is of course insanely high, but it is what it is in 2023."

Prior to the bank closing, I reported a charge to my account that was over a thousand dollars that were not made by me. The bank investigated and closed the case stating they thought I made the charge. I contact the establishment this charge was made and they agreed that since the charge was clearly not made by me that they would like to return the money but would have needed to return it to the account that was used, which was this now closed account. A week later I received an email from Avant stating that they received the money and would be sending me a check in the mail. This was 3 months ago. I call weekly and am told that they don't have a partnership with some other bank and cant send me a check until they have one. I can't believe this! After never even investigating charges I dispute, they are now holding my money. Is this even legal? I am having a hard time paying for my insulin and this bank has over a thousand dollars of my money. How is this possible?"

They refused to wave it and I told them that was petty after sending them almost $400 the previous month and that I refuse to pay. The next month they send me a bill for the interest and then a late fee. I just started getting back to fair credit again after a similar fight with BLAZE (which I reviewed here) and they're trashing my score over $7. This company is petty and charges interest even after the account is closed. They could have waved the interest and; thus, not charge me a late fee but they want to ruin people over chump change."

So I used another card to pay my tab.\n\nThe next day, I tried to use it at an online delivery app. Declined again. I got an email asking me to call to verify that I made the listed charges. I called, spent forever on hold, and the call got cut off. Called again and finally got the issue solved and my card unfrozen. I thought that was the end of it.\n\nNope. On Monday, February 20, I tried to use it again with the same delivery app. Declined. Tried again at a different retailer to see if maybe the delivery app was the problem, but declined AGAIN. Now they want me to call AGAIN to fix it.\n\nI understand wanting to protect customers from fraud, but this is BEYOND RIDICULOUS. I have to waste hours calling you every time I want to use this card? No. Not gonna happen. Fix the system on your end, don't waste my time making me fix problems that were not my fault. I've been a good customer, always make my payments on time, I don't deserve to be treated like a criminal.\n\nAnd don't bother with your canned response telling me to call again. The answer is NO. How do I know that this won't be the end of it? You have issues on your end, fix it and maybe I will remain a customer. As it is now, i will pay this thing down and then it's good riddance.

When I called the company to inquire why I was never notified that the credit limit either was going to be increased or had been increased, the first customer \"service\" representative could only read some scripted answer which did not address the question. Then he transferred me to a RUDE and CONDESCENDING \"supervisor\" who read the same script and hung up on me. I am paying off the $280 I owe these people and never using this card again. They are horrible people to do business with.\n\nResponse to AVANT response: You didn't bother to even read the review.

Once Avant proceeded they stated they was unable to give me the lower rate, that they would offer me a higher interest with apologies. Well they done hit my credit with the first offer so I took what they offered in hopes to move the loan soon."

Everyday after I would either receive an email that said \u201cplease call AVANT\u201d or upload a document in which I had already upload. This went on for 6 days, each day I would call and speak to different representatives, informing them all that I had completed those task. They would confirm with me that was accurate and told me \u201cwe will process your application and approval could can taken place within the same 24hrs.\u201d This was my same scenario every day for 6 days. On day 7, I received an email stating that my application had expired and I would have to re-apply. In disbelief I contacted Avant and the representative pretty much read my email to me, before I could even speak to tell her why I was calling. I informed her I would like to know why they dropped they ball? Why did they send the same emails to me daily with task I had already completed. When I asked for a supervisor, I was told they were on the phone with someone else and the representative would schedule a call back for the supervisor to call me\u2026 That call back never happened. Please don\u2019t waste your time with this company, please don\u2019t give them your personal information and then receive a soft or hard pull on your credit. They acted as amateurs or a scamming company. I would\u2019ve gave them zero stars if I could have."

Avant received the payment and it posted, the account was closed down 10/6/22. Avant sent me an email confirming the account was closed down at my request. Without my knowledge! Avant did not close my account and on 10/17/22. Avant charged me $11.06 in interest on a account that was closed down on 10/6/22 on a $0 balance. Avant did not report my account closed until 10/20/22. Thinking this was an error! I contact Avant and had to deal with the most incompetent, uneducated, rude, lack of empathy, and disrespectful employees in my life! I got hung up on multiple times! The Supervisor Shaniece hung up on us was stand offish forgetting her ghetto attitude is not allowed at a place of business. My wife and I got hung up on multiple times by majorityof the time! I was advise it will take the company 14 days to respond to my complaint and it will be by email. The payment is due in 8 days on account that shouldn't exist. This payment they want it not much but it's the principally of them forcing and bullying me into paying, I believe because I closed my account. The reason I closed my account is because i felt the company was the weakest link amongst all my credit cards and before this i had 3 other horrible interactions which lead to me closing my account, the right way, paying my balance in full. I would highly recommend using another company for your financial needs. They claim all these calls are recorded so they can pull up them to confirm everything I've mentioned here!\n\n\nUpdate: 11/15/2022\nAvants response is an automated response! If Avant checked their records! They'd see i already did that multiple times and got a bullsh!t response supporting their decision. Their response below is to satisfy the person reading the review to assume Avant is on top of their customer complaints. They did nothing and told me they will do nothing! I was forced to pay their fraud charges or it would impact my credit score and my \"never missed a payment\". Do business with someone else to avoid my situation."

This company is a fraud and misleading when having you apply. DO NOT APPLY for a card with them. When they do this it DIRECTLY IMPACTS your credit negatively!!!

For example, I work outside I live in South Florida, and was affected by hurricane Ian due to the amount of rain that it left behind. I asked for a late fee waiver due to me, not being able to work because of all the rain and it was denied due to company policy , not due to being a committed customer. Very bad company. I understand that most people will write good reviews, but it\u2019s only because they were not faced with certain situations as others, like myself. I asked to speak with a supervisor in which they can only repeat what the associate would say naturally. The supervisors are no help. They\u2019re just there to repeat policy \u201c\u201d they also did not leave a reference number for me so they can reply to me directly, they do not care about their customers they care only for the money, which I believe is a robbery."

        "reviewDescription": "Blocked me from using my funds on 9/26 because of a payment due on 9/25.... Get this, which I paid on the 25th on time. First, I've never had a company block funds because of a late payment by a day, but the facts are that payment was made on time and not late. They can see it in their system as pending and won't unblock until it posts, which we all know takes a couple of business days. So the majority of their customers would have to be having their funds blocked for payments they make on time, on their due date, while their payments are in pending. I even explained I'm visiting my dying dad in ICU and needed a hotel and they refused to do anything even though they can see my payment was made on time. Then, I was told that my payment would go through at the end of the day 9/26 and unblocked for 9/27. I called back 9/27 and it's still blocked, with the agent telling me it's still in pending even though I can see payment posted with a thank you note. I will never ever use this company again and am paying it off and recommend no one else use them. This policy of theirs was not in the terms and conditions when applying for credit.\n\nEdit to reply to Avant's reply: Why would I waste more time calling you when I've called three times and even spoke to a supervisor? My dad is dying, I don't need to waste my time with a company like you who didn't try to make it right several times."

        "reviewDescription": "Edit 9/30/22 - Avant announced via email that all Avant deposit accounts would be closed by 11/30/22 due to their partnership with Evolve B&T ending. Avant launched their deposit account product in December of 2021, so this product will have existed for less than a year by the time it shuts down. So much for helping underserved people huh? Shutting their bank account down after 9 months.\n\nI will leave the rest of my original review untouched, but this review was written before the shutdown notice was released to any individual customer.\n\nAvant sucks. Never forget that.\n\n\n\nI would never ever recommend Avant bank to anyone. Not in a million years.\n\nFirst off, they trick you into opening an account. Like many of you, I was looking for a credit card for those with low credit scores looking to rebuild their credit. I came across the Avant card and applied for it. After applying, I wasn\u2019t actually told if I was approved or not, I was just told \u201cthanks for applying. We have something else that might help you.\u201d I actually didn\u2019t realize this was for a checking account, but wanting the credit card I continued. Then I see I was denied the credit card. So what the heck did I just open? A checking account. Cool, so now I\u2019m stuck with this checking account I don\u2019t really want, but if there\u2019s a chance they can help me achieve a healthier financial life, I thought why not. Moved all my money over, all my bill payments, all my direct deposit, and closed my old checking account. Avant was my future for banking, I guess.\n\nThat was just over 2 months ago. Now, about 9 total weeks after opening the account, I\u2019ve closed my Avant checking account and want to warn everyone who might read this to stay the heck away from them.\n\nContinuing with their flaws, this is an anemic checking account. I haven\u2019t been able to confirm whether or not they actually use Chexsystems, but I would assume they don\u2019t; in that case, there\u2019s literally no reason to open this account unless for some reason you\u2019re not able to open one with Chime or SoFi, two other non-Chexsystems fintech companies that offer completely free feature-rich checking AND savings accounts. Avant deposit accounts are checking-only (no savings account offering whatsoever) with no APY, no Zelle, no checks, no check deposit (mobile or physical), no cash deposit, no physical locations, no peer-2-peer payment system whatsoever, no dedicated bill pay, a really bad ATM system (not even AllPoint offering), and most importantly, really bad account limits. They also code transactions like Cash App and Apple Cash as \u201cATM withdrawals,\u201d which means that you can kiss goodbye any chance of using your Avant account to pay rent (since there are no checks either), as their ATM limits are hard-capped at $310 unless you\u2019ve been their customer for over a year.\n\nNext, let\u2019s talk about their support. It basically doesn\u2019t exist. They\u2019re a bank that uses a ticket-based customer support system, which should already be a red flag for most people. If it isn\u2019t, I should tell you now that despite this ticket-based support system, customer support will still go out of their way to waste your time. I was trying to close my account and was asked to give a reason why, as well as to confirm with the last 4 of my SSN and my DOB. I gave them the last 4 and my DOB, and they came back hours later with a copy-paste of the same message asking for a reason why I\u2019m closing my account. Yes, they make you wait hours for a response but will still pester you for your opinion. Instead of just being a decent customer service representative and processing my request, they had to waste my time one last time before I ceased being their customer. Fantastic job. The most ironic thing was them telling me \u201chere are some reasons you might wanna rethink your decision.\u201d If there was any chance of me rethinking my decision, it was erased the moment you proved that you have NO respect whatsoever for my time. Aside from that, they have a phone number that you can call that isn\u2019t 24/7 (no 24 hour line whatsoever), and that\u2019s it. And just as the icing on the cake, Google is pretty much useless if you have this account; all Google results are tailored to their credit card, so whenever you search \u201cAvant\u201d or \u201cAvant checking\u201d with your problem, the ONLY results you\u2019ll receive will either be insanely basic or won\u2019t be relevant because they\u2019ll be tailored towards another product. So in my mind, this bank account has no value if you value customer support at all.\n\nAll in all, Avant\u2019s checking/deposit account is just kinda pointless. An anemic account with no features, you\u2019d be far better off with a local credit union or something like SoFi or Chime. With no customer support to back it up, this account is completely pointless and I recommend you look elsewhere if you care about your money.\n\nThanks for reading!"

Good luck.\nThen, when I was able to use it, and went online to pay the bill, I called and asked when would my payment be posted to my account. They said within one day. BUT it would not be considered available credit for 10-15 days. So really you really only have access to the the available credit on the card about 15 days out of the month? Why is it Capital One and Chase can post a payment the day you pay them and Avant needs 15 days. Paid off the card and stuck it in a drawer. Useless.\n\nUPDATE: So I reached out to Avant like their response said and asked how they were going to \"fix the situation.\" And their response was no response. The reply said to email them. And then when I did, they said I had to call. Guess what will happen when I call? This company posts responses to these reviews as a way to seem like they are listening. They are not.

This Makes me wonder if they are opening customer loan accounts just like Wells Fargo and US Bank were doing until they got caught by the FEDS. If you notice over 90% of the positive reviews are from people they invited to leave a review. Then they messed up and sent invites to people that they should not have and boom! This just shows how messed up this company is they send invites to people that will give them positive reviews. I tried clicking on the link they sent me but it was disabled even after I called them and they assured me that the link still worked even though I was going to rate them horribly. I have a feeling this is the same for everyone else that got these fraudulent review invites. DO NOT DO BUSINESS with a company that is willing to make up reviews!

I\u2019m leaning towards the latter. Since I was first approved for my Avant card I\u2019ve been having some serious issues with mass spam emails and fraudulent activity.\n\nI had 7 fraudulent charges on my Avant card last month and my attempts to rectify the issue has shown Avants true colors and I completely question their legitimacy.

To add to that, the second time I called customer service to inquire as to why it had not been resolved in all this time and had been reported despite their convincing reassurance it would not be, the customer service representative used phrases like \u201cas I was saying before you interrupted me\u201d and ultimately hung up on me.

        "reviewDescription": "I recv'd this email requesting that I write a review OF THIS 'company' on TrustPilot. Usually, I'm very astute w/who I conduct business with. However, I haven't ever had any correspondence w/this company, so any review relating to their \"'quality' of service\" would admittedly, lack credibility and be based on falsehood.\n\nI've done consumer advocacy work for over 20 years now, and have written many reviews on several sites. Typically, a legit company doesn't solicit or request that customers review them. That's almost wholly initiated voluntarily. But Avant admittedly caters to low credit score applicants in their issuing of Secured Credit Cards.\n\nHowever, given that my score is actually exceptional, I'd have absolutely NO USE for their services. My guess, quite frankly, is that they're soliciting Shadow Reviews from unsuspecting applicants in order to bolster their image. Well they've met their match here!!!\n\nSuffice it to say though, not having EVER done business with them B4, doesn't otherwise prevent me from suggesting or stating that I feel that this 'company' is employing a questionable business tactic in their quest to bolster their image for added recognition.\n\nIf, however, they reach out to me and can substantiate my actually contacting them, then clearly I'd reconsider this posting, based on what I then learn, and modify this review! My guess though...that'll never happen.\n\nUntil then, \"Avant\" seems a bit SCANT to me!!!\n\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\nMy response to their \"Blow-off\":\nBelow this supplement, you'll see what, in effect, is a tacit denial and an outright failure to take responsibility for their predatory marketing practices rather to instead, do what's right and own up to their engagement in these bogus marketing practices that prey on less aware individuals! Maybe the FTC would be interested in their game-plan?!"

Now who ever developed the App is really bad at their job and needs to step down. 1st- it doesn't track your spending with exact change, it rounds it self up to the next dollar so when you get close to your limit, you end up hitting it $15 early. So a few weeks ago I went out of town and ended up using $980. So that should leave me with $520. I'm at home and trying to buy an item online from a timed auction and win. I put in my card numbers to pay and it kept saying declined. It cant be cause of no credit so I don't understand what's going on. I call them up to be told that they're having technical problems and all accounts were frozen. Needless to say, I lost the item and couldn't even use my remaining credit for a full 2 months. I was told as soon as it's fixed that I would receive a email but that never happened. I just randomly discovered it on my own, just past the 2 month mark. What's funny is that they could still do statements, collect your payments for sure and create new Ads to get you to make extra payments to get ahead.\nSo this month (August) I made an attempt to make 2 early payments and then my monthly payment. The app gave me alot of trouble taking my new card# from my Square account but finally got it, or maybe not. My 2 $50 payments and my $100 one got canceled. Now once I realized it, it's past the due date and I get hit with a $25 late fee. I didn't receive a single email for any of the payment problems, no text, or nothing in my app portal. This is horrible and a super sloppy way to run a financial institution. Stay away and Don't Say That I Didn't Warn You!!!!!"

You will have to keep checking your application if it needs to be updated. I applied last Wednesday night, about 4pm. I called on Friday to check the status and they kept speaking quick and he said he needed to submit it for review and is there anything else he could help me with, he tried to get me to hang up, but I stayed on the line. 20 minutes later he comes back and asks why my paystub comes from a different company and not mine, I had to explain this to him. After that, another THREE days they sent me an email to call them, and they told me my paystub bank account did not match the bank account I gave them. It was completely false, I literally had to walk them through the difference between a routing number and an account number. This took AN HOUR. Also they don't speak clear english. Finally resolving it they took another day to post I need to verify other income to get to the right Net income, which was not correct because my net income was already OVER what they pre-approved me with. I think it was just stalling at this point because I submitted my husbands checks asap and they let it sit again without updating it. Then today I get an email that my loan application EXPIRED, and I would have to reapply. I have NO interest in getting a loan through this company anymore. I think they just collect your information for fraud reasons and then go about their day. No sense of urgency with them. You will not get a loan approved before it expires. Every review I have read that seems real, they all have the SAME issues.\n\nUPDATE: I will not be giving them a second chance. I secured a different loan on better terms from Prosper in 24 hours."

They kept asking for the same documents over and over. Each time I submitted the documents, they would say I didn\u2019t need to do anything else, but they would never say whether or not the loan was approved. Finally after 7 days, I received an email saying my application had expired and I could re-apply! So I did on 7/28/22. I got the same run around with the document requests but no follow-up from Avant. After a couple days, I just told them to cancel my application. I was frustrated. Not because I didn\u2019t get the loan, but because they weren\u2019t professional enough to let me know one way or another. I felt like just another piece of paper, rather than a person. If that\u2019s the way they treat people, I\u2019m glad I don\u2019t have to do business with them. Oh, by the way, before I paid off the previous loan, I paid every payment on time.\n\nHelen R.

I complied because of the importance of this loan. Yes i was eventually approved but it was apparent that there wad a lack of communication between Avant representatives.

I asked her to do that. She then said it would be an email with decision. Within 10 minutes it was declined. I think they need to do a better job training their staff"

I only got it to help with my credit and its not even reporting. I will be paying it and full and cashing it out on my next payday. Had I known what I knew now I would not have gotten it."

They keep my money but when or if they return it without interest. 144% interest on my loan but no interest on keeping my money. ***UPDATE*** Today is 02/20/2024 and I'm still waiting for my refund. Was told this past Thursday that the refund would be there on friday. Guess what it's Tuesday and was told again today 3 to 5 days but they are trying to expedite it.

So except the terms and sign the loan agreement and think we are getting funds in the next 24 hours like it says. Nope no funds I get an email later that day that we both need to send in information to verfiy my ID, SS card and recent bank statement. We both send the required info I call back they got both of our information and good to go. They said need to sign back in and except the terms and the loan again and sign we do that then told get the funds in another 24 hours. Okay at this point I am like okay wow this as gone on for 2 days now back and forth. I have been told I was approved and get my funds and haven\u2019t. I check my email today and we both got an email saying we were denied. I am like what denied for what we were told we were approved it says this reason for denial \u201cunable to verify application information based on documents provided\u201d. So at that point I\u2019m frustrated and upset feel lied to and betrayed I call back and ask for a better clarification they can\u2019t give me one they said it\u2019s automatic generated response I am like give me a number don\u2019t have one. Wow and no one there a supervisor no one can assist. They tell me all you can do is wait the 10 days and apply again wow I\u2019m thinking and this is a company. They should be taking to court on this and sued. They even hit me with a hard inquiry and it says will run credit for a hard inquiry once signed and approved well I was WTH!!!!!

How can companies charge like loansharks in the movies. read that again, they made over 9k and was scheduled to make 10k on a 5k loan with payment terms less than 24 months. Again, like i said, atleast they got me the money when i needed it, but this helps explain why the rich get rich and the poor gets poorer.

        "reviewDescription": "I NEVER thought getting a loan would be so EASY! I went to a typical financial institution to ask for a loan and there was so much red tape involved, you not only had to fill out a lot of paper work, you had to have collateral, and get insurance placed on yourself and the collateral and that added cost is also ADDED to your loan amount, which adds 1000's of dollars to your loan, on top of that you STILL have to pay interest on the entire amount! For example, you may get a check for $6999, the insurance on you and your collateral may cost another $10,000 bringing your loan to around 17k, add interest and you are paying back 35k, when you only received a check for $6999. Do the math you pay back 5 times what you actually took home! With Rise the loan was fast and easy! The money was in the bank the next day and the payment plan is simple to follow. The loan can even be paid off early, saving you money! Thanks Rise, the next time I need money fast, I will come here first!!"

        "reviewTitle": "Stay away!!!",
        "reviewDescription": "Stay away!!!! Interest rates are way too high. I have used Rise for years and this year was the straw that broke the camel's back. When applying for a loan, I always select the $2,250 loan with a payment schedule of 20 payments. This current loan I selected to do the same payment schedule. Fast forward a couple of months, I noticed my balance never went down only kept rising. Generally after a few payments, I would see a dollar or two come off of the balance, but this time I've only seen significant increases. I went to look at my contract and somehow my payback schedule was changed from 20 payments to 44 payments. I immediately called Rise Credit customer service to see if there was a glitch in the system because I would never select to make roughly the same payments I've made in a previous loan agreement for a longer term. So, now this new loan agreement is saying if I make all 44 payments will have paid back $8,430.79 for a $2250.00 loan. A total of $10680.78\n\nHere is the breakdown from the last three loans I have gotten through rise:\n\n1. (2023 44 weeks) $2250 270.85% $242.72 biweekly\n\n(8/30/2023 Edit: I received an email from Rise Credit corporate office stating that the rates and terms for a $2250 loan have changed from a maximum of 26 biweekly payments to a maximum of 44 biweekly payments. You no longer have the option to choose 20 or 26 payments. So, if you decide to go through with the loan for those 44 biweekly payments, you will have paid back $10,680.79 for a $2250 loan. The rates and terms on the \"What it costs\" tab are inaccurate.\n\n2. (2022 20 weeks) $2250 272.95% $262.20 biweekly\n\n3. (2021 20 weeks) $2250 277.97% $277.97 biweekly\n\nI am trying to figure out why in the world would I select to make more payments for roughly the same amount of money I was repaying in previous loans. I kept telling the representatives I spoke with that I would not select that. Also, if I selected to make 44 payments instead of 20 payments like I always do, wouldn't my payments be less?\n\nSomething is not right and I know it. I have been trying to get the corporate office on the phone, but no one will return my calls. I need answers.\n\nWhatever you do, find another way because this company is scamming people.\n\nPlease, please, please pay close attention to every click you make. Screenshot every step, especially the rates and payback schedule you select. Go back and check to make sure your clicks were correctly recorded. Also, making extra payments towards your loan does not go towards your principal balance. You will be making extra payments for nothing. Either pay off as fast as you can or make regularly scheduled payments.\n\nMost importantly FIND ANOTHER SOURCE TO GET MONEY FROM."

I do appreciate the help but the interest is ridiculous. It\u2019s like they help to get out of a bind but just to get into one 5 times more then the one you was in smh."

This also occurs when you finally are able to get a customer service rep on the phone as well.\n\nThis continues to happen over the same request for months now, which is ridiculous. Who is managing & training @ Rise or even cares enough at Rise to actually follow thru with anything other than their own agenda?\nNot one person has corrected the request even now, which causes more frustration and headache than needed.\n\nAbsolutely ridiculous!

My bank sent them a check on 4/22 and it was never received. I spoke to Rise customer service and was told checks are credited to accounts same day received. So, My bank sent another overnight to them on 5/17 with tracking and signature required. It was received 5/18 and signed for by an employee. Several calls since then and given multiple varying answers. Once it wasn\u2019t received. Next it was noted as received on my account and would post by 5pm that day (it did not), then they would contact me within 24 hours and it would be \u201cescalated\u201d \u2014 no call. I called them with my bank on three-way, and was informed it had not been received and they couldn\u2019t verify if the person who signed had it or not\u2026and that it would take 7-10 days from receipt to post\u2026tons of excuses and lies! When the original check was mailed it would\u2019ve paid this loan off. Now I have accrued over $400 in interest atop the original amount thanks to their daily interest charges. Wish I\u2019d NEVER hit the accept button on this \u201cloan\u201d and I HIGHLY advise you to avoid them at all cost! I\u2019ve paid my loan every month, on-time, and never an issue until I want to pay it off to better myself and get out from under some debt. This company is nothing more than a payday loan service at best. Complete and total loan sharks with horrible customer service and extremely questionable business practices. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere. There are better alternatives. Take it from me!"

The application process is easy, they work with you when you experience hardship, they take debit card payments which is oddly uncommon. I used to highly recommend them. Until today.\n\nI applied for a loan on Thursday 3/17. As a returning customer, the process was super easy. Just confirmed nothing had changed, hit submit, and was approved. I signed the loan agreement and they said the funds would be in my account the next day. The next day, the money isn't in my account. I log on and it shows my loan is in the funding status. Ok, maybe they sent it that day and it would be in my account the next business day. Sunday I received an email reminding me that my first payment would be due on Friday 3/25. Today, not only was the money not in my account, but I received a request for more information. I sent the information right away, and almost immediately received an email saying my loan was declined. I'm researching whether this is illegal, but is unquestionably immoral and shameful from a customer service standpoint. I will never borrow from Rise again and can no longer recommend that anyone else do either."

        "reviewDescription": "At first I thought I found a decent company. The plan was to be able to repay the loan fast. However, my situation changed and my hope for a quick payoff disappeared. The payment from this company is far higher than any other similar loan companies I have used in the past. This is why I hoped to pay the loan off fast. Then when I hit a rough spot and fell behind in payments I attempted to work with RISE. They did offer a 3 payment plan to bring my account current. However, they locked my online account. So instead of allowing me the fastest possible way to make my payments, RISE made it incredibly difficult to make my payment plan payments. I tried to chat with customer service but they are useless. RISE even blocks their own customer service people from helping customers trying to make things right. All customer service does is give you a phone number to call. I found that to be a waste of time as well. Nor do I have time during the day to make phone calls and hang on the line forever! I was also told that after making 2 payments RISE would make 1 payment as part of the agreement to catch up my account. I was able to see my payment history, and to no surprise to me, one of my payments was missing in the payment history. What did RISE do with my payment? Did they hide my payment so they could claim I didn't make it and not make the single payment promised to me? All I can say is if you are thinking about using this company for a loan, I would recommend trying some other company. I have found RISE uncooperative and unresponsive when trying to contact them. Also very unhelpful when you want to work with them. I have filed several complaints with the company with no meaningful response what so ever!! I hope this makes it to the top of the review list because you should be very cautious about using this company!"

So I have to wait the following day to get ahold of a rep to change it. So, I'm taking their word for it. No confirmation. Then I asked if they could reimburse me for the $161.45 they took out of my account and 2 days later received an email DENIED. They are predatory lender!!

I go to login in on their site ( I wrote down my credentials) and it would not work so I utilized the lost password feature . It did not send me a code nor a email link to reset . I tried both mobile and desk top . Used the auto chat feature and that was zero help . Emailed the helpdesk and they insisted i had forgotten my own bank login?? LOL If they would have read my email they would have comprehended that I was trying to access THEIR site . ZERO customer service , zero care . If they are this absent minded with a brand new app... do I really trust them with my personal financial info ?? No . And now I am reading BBB reports . I am staying away . Ridiculous"

But, after reading a few reviews and seeing how happy people were with their services I decided on giving them a try. The process went smoother than I expected. I did everything online. They reviewed everything within a day or so and before the weekend was over from when I applied on a Friday I had the funds in my account come Monday morning. I am very pleased with how fast the process went and how fast I got the funds. Granted, the APR% is very high, but I don't plan on paying the loan for that long, my goal is to try and pay it off earlier. Other than the APR%, I will most likely use them again if I ever needed to."

I am still shocked the website does not have a pop where you enter an account number that warns applicants about the risk and consequences of a typo. Although I don't think it was a typo because I entered it twice and double-checked.

What affected my credit rating was the plethora of hard inquiries accumulated while i was looking for a loan that i could afford (99% is high but it's commensurate with risk and i understand that. High risk, high reward.) However, it pales in comparison to 150% to 450%. Yes, bunky, there are 450% loans out there.

I called a customer service representative who told me my balance on the loan was $2685.97. I paid it and the next day received an email that my account had been paid off! A few days later, they retracted and said I need to pay my payment for 277.77 for April. What in the entire HECK! I have paid off using all of my stimulus money, I have given a total of $3519.28 for a $3000 loan I took out 3months ago.

I tried canceling initially right after I accepted since there\u2019s a 5 day grace period, but they wouldn\u2019t cancel. I called to find out what was going on and they claimed they never received the email to cancel and it was too late. At that point, hundreds in interest had already accrued. They eventually came back saying the found the email which was annoying.\n\nFast forward to this year, my hours were cut like a lot of people so I had to extended the payment date a few times which didn\u2019t help me at all because the balance jumped up to an unmanageable amount.\n\nSince I wasn\u2019t late on the loan, they wouldn\u2019t work out a settlement with me and the balance kept going up and up. They finally decided to work out a settlement (still not a reasonable offer they gave) and I ended up agreeing just because I wanted it to be over with. I paid the settlement in full on the day agreed, and they took forever to update the account. The loan still kept accruing interest after the settlement payment was made and they wouldn\u2019t update anything.\n\nThey finally updated it but a few days after they did, they reported me as 30-60 days late to the credit bureaus!!!!!!!!!! The reason I had such an issue getting them to offer a settlement was because I WASNT late or past due from what they kept telling me! So how do they report me as late after we agreed to settle on a specific date and the payment was made when we agreed!?!?!?!?! They told me multiple times I couldn\u2019t pay before the settlement date after we generated the paperwork because any payment I made at that point would not go towards the settlement.\n\nThey are frauds and they just want to scam people out of their money. I\u2019ve already grossly overpaid them if I add up all of the monthly payments I made along with the settlement, now they\u2019re trying to report me as late and they increased the balance due to a crazy amount because they continued to accrue interest after we had agreed to a settlement amount AND after I made the payment!\n\nThey have no compassion on anyone during this time. The company is simply worried about money and that\u2019s it. If I\u2019m not working like I was before all of this started and I\u2019m struggling to survive, how can you expect customers to be able to make payments with such high interest rates?? To not even lower the payment amount it interest rates during this time is disgusting! The money I wasted paying this billion dollar company interest could really help during these difficult times.\n\nI just don\u2019t understand how the interest rates offered are even legal. They actually aren\u2019t in CA anymore and Rise won\u2019t don\u2019t anything to help out.\n\nThis company is sick and please don\u2019t wast your time with these types of places!!!!!\n\nI\u2019m currently looking into starting a class action suit in CA!"

I made all my payments on time and in full and was in good standing so I thought they\u2019d show some empathy. Maybe say \"Sure, let\u2019s see how we can help!\" But they would not work with me on my payments for the final 3 months I had left. I'll never take out a loan with them again. The customer service rep was not friendly and just didn't care.\n\nI finally got around to making a payment. After I made the payment, they sold my account to collections. I'll never be a customer of theirs again.\n\nUpdate to their reply:\nYou showed no empathy to a loyal customer who always paid on time. Your reply is generic and unhelpful. It\u2019s all about money and NOT your customers. I continue to be disappointed by customer service."

Took no time to get the money in my bank account.\nI was able to then pay it off a few weeks later and not pay too much in interest.

You have all your payments listed and shows the interest you are paying as it builds up so there is no surprises.

I did exactly what she asked and was declined. I called back to ask why I was declined and the second rep I spoke with advised me that the application I filled out was for a \"refinance\" and the system did that in error. She advised to just wait until the next day and the system would allow me to apply for an actual loan again. Of course the next day the system did NOT allow me to apply again. I then called back and spoke with a 3rd rep who advised me that I was declined because of my \"credit score\" and i needed to wait 45 days to apply again. He also advised that I should of just refinanced the loan instead of paying it out, an option i was never offered in the beginning.

I emailed Rise on 22nd requesting to cancel the loan because it says on THEIR website that\u2019s you have 5 business days to cancel.\n\nI didn\u2019t receive a response so I called them on Monday late afternoon to verify they had canceled the loan and would rake the money back out of my account. I was told that somehow they never received my message even though I logged into my rise account and contacted them through their site. I received the confirmation message saying someone would respond, but they insist they didn\u2019t receive it.\n\nI told the lady I was speaking with that I\u2019m 10000% positive it said my message went through, and regardless I would still like to cancel because Monday would be the 5th business day so I was still within the 5 day period even if they wanted to lie and say my message wasn\u2019t received.\n\nI was told that yes, it was the 5th business day, but that I missed the cut off tome to cancel!!!! No where on their website does it say there\u2019s a time I have to call to cancel. I could understand if the place was closed, but clearly they weren\u2019t seeing as how I was speaking to someone!! I\u2019m so frustrated because now they are saying I owe $144 dollars in interest for a loan that I didn\u2019t even use and tried to cancel within their grace period.\n\nHow in the world do I already owe $144 dollars in interest in 1 weeks time! That\u2019s disgusting and they should be ashamed of themselves. They clearly lied saying they never received the message in order to keep me from canceling the loan just so they could rip me off and take my money.\n\nThey also are trying to get around the new California law that was passed and is supposed to be effective 1/1/20 that prevents loan companies from charging more than 36% in interest.\n\nThis company isn\u2019t ethical and they will lie to rip you off.

My payment plan they will get there interest first and only after the first year.so if you pay 225 every two weeks they add 16.44 every day which equals 115 each week before you even make the first payment. As they responded to you review you will see how they advised me before hand and try to make it sound as if they did please note I'm not unhappy I decided to take the offer but they will respond like this. Dont sit there and respond to something I spoke the truth on. Also the customer service spoke with me and advised me that it was not in the contract but the additional interest is was the lender adds to you depending on the loan you applied for.

I did not have a negative balance per my visit to my branch and my account was in good standing. So I don\u2019t understand.\n\nI am very saddened to experience this up hill battle twice. My opinion, this experience tells me a lot about a company. If you need help you won\u2019t get it here.\n\nI hope no one else has to experience this communication failure.\n\nRespectfully,"

Got what I needed and was saved from losing my apartment after getting hit with dental surgery that wasn't optional. Had enough left over to get my credit cards back below 30% AND pay off of a small loan I had. Maxed cards out paying bills beforehand and it wrecked my credit to below 600. Credit score will be over 700 soon. Never seen such flexible payments. I get paid bi-weekly, so my paydays are always odd dates. I was able to select that as a payment option. Payments come out the day I get my check, so I can't screw this up. Wow! So impressive! Wish I never dealt with another loan company. I wish my other large loan was with Rise.

I received an invitation in the mail, entered my offer code and info and had the funds the next morning.\n\nUnfortunately, my experience in trying to get another loan has been beyond frustrating. I'm left with the feeling that RISE doesn't really want me as a customer or my 150% interest.\n\nThe first attempt resulted in my application being closed promptly after providing verification documents with no real explanation why.\n\nThe second attempt (started July 9th) resulted in a \"48-business-hour\" review process that turned into 9 days. I called RISE support earlier this week and the rep ignored my questions as to why the process was taking much longer than expected. (I felt like I was talking to a recording.)\n\nFinally yesterday I was advised to log in to the system and review the result of the Review. I was unable to actually access the page the email directed me to view; I was sent instead to complete another application. Confused, I called support yet again and was instructed that I was approved and just needed to fill out the forms again. So I did. Which then resulted in a duplicate loan in the system and re-opening the original loan from July 9th.\n\nThen, I get another email advising me to provide the same documentation (ID, SS card, proof of income) I had already provided before and wait another supposed 48 business hours.\n\nDon't bother emailing support, either. Email support is just as bad as phone support. What does that leave? Not doing business with RISE, I suppose.\n\nLesson learned: Approved does not actually mean approved, even if a support rep explicitly uses the phrase \"you're approved\"."

And, as far as I can tell, the statements about reporting to credit bureaus is false as well, nothing from them on either of the 3.

I made a similar review on the better business bureau website and they asked me to reach out to them so they could look into this account. I emailed them my issue and the response I received was that they were looking into my account and if they needed more information they would get back to me. I never got s response so I emailed again looking for a follow up. Have never heard back. They are a fine company until you look for assistance. Please do not get caught into the same mess that I have and exhaust all options before you take this loan. I have 2 payments left and will struggle through to make those just to be done with these predatory lenders. And please do not believe the responses you see from the company reaching out to resolve bad reviews, they are just attempting to look responsive."

I'm not sure if you mandated to have that information on every single page on the application or if you do that for your own personal reasons, but it's annoying and it makes me feel like I shouldn't want to do business with you.

Based on that pay date, my payment due date for the loan was set for the 15th of the month for the duration of the loan. That is a problem for me since my paycheck arrives on the 3rd Wednesday of the month, which can fall anywhere from the 15th to the 20th of the month. I asked Customer Service if I could change the scheduled loan payment date. The answer was \u201cNo\u201d, but that I had a \u201c7-day\u201d grace period in which I could change the payment due date each month 2 days before the scheduled due date. Not only is that arrangement inconvenient and risky, it comes at a price: additional accrued interest.\n\nYou can choose to get your loan money by direct deposit with automatic loan payment withdrawals from your bank account or you can get a loan check by snail mail and pay by check. With either option Rise is betting many borrowers will missed a scheduled payment date so they\u2019ll earn extra interest or late fees.\n\nSo, please, please, please read all the fine print and ask Customer Support all your questions before you push that button accepting the loan.\n\nBy virtue of your needing a ridiculously high interest loan, the deck is stacked against you, and Rise knows that."

If you are borrow a very small sum of money (under $1,000k) they maybe able to help you without you feeling cheated. But anything over, you will definitely pay the price. If your credit is not good, just skip over because you will be paying probably around 90% or more in interest. Know what you are getting yourself into. If I could do it over, I would have never taken out the loan $3,500 just costed me $5,745.68 in a matter of 8 months."

I had the option to refinance and get possibly a lower interest rate and bam it was higher. I will NOT refinance nor recommend nor take out another loan when this miserable loan is done. I have also made additional payments and they just deduct that from my bi weekly payment so that doesn't help. This is not a good place for a loan!!!

I have a good job just had a divorce and some credit issues and need funds for a medical deductible. I applied submitted the application and all the documentation. I had to call and email 10 times. Yes, that is not a typo 10 times to find out what the status was. There was always something else holding up the process. I log onto my email this morning after another email I had sent asking what the status was and I was told I had to reapply. WHAT!!! are you kidding me. I did all the right things emailed the documentation to them and had to constantly follow up just to be asked for additional information. So please just a word of caution before applying. The people on the phone are nice but good is that if you cant get a result that you need. Not applying for a super high interest loan because you want to pay that rate."

        "reviewDescription": "I got a mailer that I was pre-approved for $3000. I didn\u2019t believe it at first and didn\u2019t apply since I get mail offers all the time! I hate doing online loans most time cuz most ask for so much paperwork and by then I quit cuz it\u2019s not worth it!\nI honestly make good money, don\u2019t pay a mortgage since I live with family that helps\nWith my kids. The reasons why I tried this was to see if truly this was going to work as it stated! I have had bad credit due to long ago medical bills! All the bad reports are medical bills! And also I have not checked my credit for last 5 years! Thanks to RISE i decided to check my reports and omg, there were so many mistakes on it! So out of curiousness I applied! All it did was ask me simple questions, basics! Then it asked how much I made, where I worked, and to fill in my checking account info\nThen it took me to a page that stated I was approved! Then had me go through several legal documents to check mark and also let me see exactly what I was approved for, how much each monthly payment would be, and the terms! I even had the choice to choose a smaller loan amount, and either faster payoff terms or longer! I loved that RISE gave me\nThe option to choose what amounts I wanted to really borrow! Either take the $3000 or less. It was all up to me!\nYes it\u2019s high in payback, and something I normally would never take as a loan but I now know of RISE in case of any future emergency and I now know they are very transparent and give you plenty of chances to take the loan or not! That to me tells me they truly are here to\nHelp those that need help! And are really not\nAbout taking your money! They give you many opportunities to back out even a no risk 5 day cancellation after your funding too if you change your mind!\nYou can\u2019t complain about the fees when your the one that is desperate for help that no other company will give you! If you don\u2019t like the fees of paying back the loan no one said you had to ask for the help! But don\u2019t ask for help then complain or give 1-2 stars cuz the rate! They gave me fair and plenty of information on how this is for emergencies and even tell you other ways to loan for less fees and interest!\nI didn\u2019t need this in desperate measures but I took a loan and will surely pay back each month and I did it cuz it is rare to have a company trust those who have a horrible credit score when no one else will and in such very simple ways! It took me 10 minutes to apply! That is it and I did not have to turn in any documents at all and money will be in next business day!\nI don\u2019t work for Rise or represent them I am just a Normal person, it was my choice to write this and I wanted to cuz it\u2019s beyond me that people could sit here and complain or give less than 5 stars for taking a loan, getting help from RISE knowing full well the costs of the payback the percentage rate etc! They were more than overly transparent! If you thought the rate, or monthly payment was high then why do\nYou take the help no one else will give you then insult the people who helped you and by no means of hiding anything!\nI just went through the process, and I was told\nMore than needed that this was a loan for urgent needs thus higher and more expensive rates! They don\u2019t hide that! And they let you know this throughout the entire process to make sure you know!\nSo to all those who take the help of someone that offers and gives you help that no one else will, and you take it. Then you complain! Wow\nGreat way of disrespecting the company that helped you when no one else probably and most likely didn\u2019t! I know how it is when times are hard, we all do. No one has a perfect life, one day you can have a great job and make great money and it can be gone the next in a flash! So it is beyond important to be humble, and not to let money change you for the worst! Money is evil and it is the #1 thing that can turn brother against brother and wife against a husband! That is powerful! I once was at a great place, it took one car accident to turn my life 360! Going from independence to dependence! The fact that your so desperate to have to ask friends and family it can bring a persons soul in a dark and unhappy place! Some are lucky they have people they know who will and can afford to help, but know that when you do borrow and ask for help, there is always going to be a thought in your mind that you owe that person more than the money you borrowed! It\u2019s better to ask for help with programs like RISE! There is no personal attachment or that \u201cI owe you forever and will do anything for you for what you did\u201d feeling! Cuz if that person you did get help from ever has something they can\u2019t do themselves, best believe that you will be that person they will turn to! Take only what you need! And borrow here the exact amount that will help you, and use it to get out of whatever bad spot your in! RISE approved exactly what they said they would, and in 10 min I was approved and confirmed for next business day deposit! I am\nGlad that I chose to try it out cuz now I know one company that will truly help when I need it and faster than any bank!\nRise your a saint! Thanks for all the help and for giving so many people the chance to rebuild their credit and to get out of emergency situations!! I don\u2019t know how it is that you will trust all of use that have shown not so great credit, but I believe it is cuz you too may have once been in a spot where you had no help! Perhaps the owner knows how it is to be so desperate for help and not get it! RISE I give you blessings for the countless people you have saved , when in their darkest moments of desperation! Your a saint and your name says it all! RISE from your sadness and hopelessness and then keep rising to a better place!"

I called them and they told me that I had signed the paperwork and there was nothing they could do about changing the rules. Yes they can, it\u2019s their company. Instead they just wanted all the fees and interest to keep accruing because anything that goes over the $2500 value they can charge what they want to. Everything under that to a $2500 cap off they would have have to keep its payments and fees minimal. It\u2019s the law. I had borrowed $3000 and paid well over $1600 back. I went to a consolidation company and then RISE waited 59-68 days to add it to my credit report. That\u2019s a shame!!!

If it says I can extend a payment 24/7 through your automated phone system you need a way to do that. Also it seems that when your office is closed your online account management system will not load so we can not access our account online after business hours. It is not my computer because I tried on multiple computers. Really need this remedied Rise."

She was too proud to tell me she was struggling, got a preapproved offer from Rise and went for it thinking they'd approve her for $500 or something. At 77 years old, she lives on only her meager $600 social security checks each month. Yet somehow...Rise approved her for a $1,500 loan this month. Um. She gets $600 a month?! And the interest rate is downright obscene. So now, they'll take more than half of her monthly income for the next year until the loan plus interest is paid.\n\nThe fact that Rise approved her on $600 a month income derived solely from Social Security is the epitome of predatory lending. Not to mention, she lives in Arizona where Rise supposedly does not even do business. Not sure how that happened - her income statement, drivers license, etc. all show AZ as her place of residence. I've just contacted the Attorney General in Arizona, and am going to make sure I cause as much ruckus as I can about this company and their illegal tactics to prey on seniors."

It was several days of back and forth over documentation and they were not quick about notifying you when they were not satisfied with documents submitted. All three times notifications were sent, it was after the cut-off date for receiving information which pushed completion of my application several more days after the request.

However, upon doing so through their website, the requirements are to use Google Chrome, which I already have, Yet, chrome wasn't what it needed at all. Within chrome, none of the drop down boxes would work and no information could be put in, and at the bottom of the page it would display \" processing\" ! You can't process if no information is input into the system. This was on a Saturday, called and the employee , friendly, walked through it all and again stated that chrome was the browser to be used. All setting on my end were checked and double checked to ensure nothing was being blocked and was being performed correctly. Therefore, the loan could not be processed and an \"issue ticket\" was ordered and submitted to their IT dept to find out what the problem was. The problem was their end, without any doubt ( I work in IT )\nWith it being on the weekend , it would be Monday before it would be addressed and fixed and was told an email would be sent to confirm. By Tuesday, no email, no call and I called to inquire, was told by a rude girl that a ticket was put in and would be fixed, I asked for it to be escalated and was rudely told that any ticket submitted was escalated . ( which only means, first come, first served ) No one could seem to explain why this was happening, perhaps speaking to the IT person would have been a better solution, but that was not an option, this company prefers to communicate via email ONLY, not a good practice as some may not have access to Internet at all times. But was told it would be fixed and notified by next day ( Wed) It's currently Thursday and still no money ! However, something told me to try Internet Explorer and BOOM it worked ! Was able to complete the application and it was being processed ! Great . right ? NOPE ! Received an email that the problem was fixed and the account was reset and I had to go back and re-apply ! Nooo, it had already been done through Internet Explorer and and was processing and re-applying was NOT an option ! So, fotthe amount of money you are raping people for, how about possibly paying for some REAL Internet Technicians that know what they are doing ! Nothing worse than the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing ! COMMINICATE with each other internally and with the customer, test your systems on all browsers and educate yourselves, clearly you don't have a good system and your emplyess needs better training !"

The automated phone system eventually hung up on me. When I called back again, I just picked an option hoping the Customer Service Representative would be able to transfer me to the correct person. My call was answered by someone with a very thick Indian accent that had me verify my account information. She was able to transfer me to someone who could reset my account, but I had to wait on hold for a very long time. After re-verifying all of my account information again, this new CSR was able to unlock my account."

Most people I know who have used them have had SOME issue with them.\n\nI had a loan with them in 2021 for about $5k. I paid it off in 6 months by coincidence because my VA case settled and I received a large sum of money.\n\nFast forward to today, I was looking at my credit report and noticed that in my Transunion section, they remarked my loan with them as \u201c Canceled by credit grantor\u201d. Might seem benign right? CANCELED is not typically used on loans that have been paid off correctly. CANCELED by credit grantor is often associated with something bad on your credit report. These little details matter.\n\nI disputed it and of course, they couldn\u2019t change it. What is an absolute minor detail for them, and a major one for me, they couldn\u2019t change.\n\nDO NOT GO WITH ONE MAIN. Their entire business model is designed around enslaving desperate people into loans with excruciatingly high interest that you will never be able to pay off. And if you do pay it off, they will get their last lick by reflecting it poorly on your credit.\n\nAgain, these amount of positive reviews have GOT TO BE PAID.\n\nEDIT FOR FUTURE VIEWERS: NOTICE how they took the time to respond to the claim of paid reviews, but could give FK all about their mishandling of my credit report? You see what you will deal with now?\n"

If you do miss a payment, don't worry, they'll immediately report you as delinquent to all credit bureaus.

So it\u2019s been very hard on us financially not being able to get to work and having to take a Lyft every day to and from work. Very unreliable. When I signed the loan agreement over a week ago, I was told it would be deposited into my checking account the next day and when it wasn\u2019t, they made me wait 3 days\u2026.

I told her what happened and even mentioned I had taken out a loan last year at that location and even paid it off early. She told me yep that's what happens, made it very clear she was not interested in looking at the situation or helping me at all. I was made offers by several other companies but wanted to do business with this one since everything went very smooth the last time. I know there had to have been a glitch since the system was having problems recognizing my social security number for my account but they obviously do not care and assume that anyone calling about being rejected must automatically have bad credit. I do not usually respond to things but the person was so quick to get rid of me on the phone and not wanting to hear anything more I felt it needed to be addressed.

Also, payment options are super slim to adding your bank account details, what if I just want ro process a debit transaction.. that's A no... Not sure about all the other super extra positive reviews but this is my honest opinion/ review.. This company as a whole can really do better starting with there customer service PLEASE.

So instead of making an automatic payment of 24 cents the next month they didn\u2019t do anything, didn\u2019t contact me, nothing. Then the following month they reported my account as delinquent to the credit bureaus, really messing up my credit score. For 24 cents!!!!! I will never understand why they didn\u2019t adjust the last payment 24 cents higher to pay off the loan totally, or at least contact me in some manner regarding the 24 cent balance. The only way I discovered this was a notification from a credit bureau saying I had a delinquent account and my credit score had gone down. Seriously!!

I think it's BS, and if I had it to do over, I wouldn't use them, I'd look elsewhere, and you should too. UPDATE!! One Main asked me to call them, I did, and I discovered that 1. Being an existing customer with on time payment history DOESN'T MATTER to them. 2. Your application isn't even checked by a real person, a computer makes the final decision. Just wondering if my AGE is a factor...hmmm Stay far far away from doing business with this company. Update #2.. more BS, they acknowledged that I have a perfect payment history, not only with them but my other accounts, but their \"computer said I was some sort of risk.

They never call you to make payment arrangements but they call wanting you to just make a payment instead.\nCathy is beyond rude and shouldnt be working in customer service. I had to call them after hours and basically yell at them to quit calling my phone 4 to 6 times daily...now they only call me twice a day but it is always after 6pm cause they think I am home.\nOnce my loan is paid off I will never use One Main again.

So basically, you're asking me to borrow $12,000 for the sake of needing $4,000.

As part of the loan process, One Main requested that a loan to Wells Fargo issued in my name which I was not keen on doing. Supposedly, a check was mailed to Wells Fargo in the amount of $3,939.00 to pay off loan. As of today (01/13/2024), the check has not been received by Wells Fargo. One Main Financial has offered every excuse in the world to say that the check was indeed mailed on 12/28/2023. They have even claimed that Wells Fargo may be holding the check to make sure it is a good check. Even if that is so, the time for that to have occurred has already passed by. One Main Financial has refused to do anything except make sure that I will make their payment on the designated due date. i have contacted Wells Fargo to be on the lookout for the check. One Main Financial should step up and do a thorough investigation into where the check is. The check has surely have had enough time to be posted to my account at Wells Fargo. One Main has stated that their check writing company has confirmed and has offered to do a stop payment on the check after 30 days. That act would mean that I will have to make another installment payment to Wells Fargo plus make two payments to One Main Financial during that same thirty day period. That suggestion is ludicrous."

I don't consider $5,000 to be a small amount but that's what was still owed on the vehicle. I feel like Jason dropped the ball and wasn't honest from the beginning. We were not approved for a loan so that's it but it would have been nice to know this weeks ago. They act like it's easy and anybody can get a loan but that's not true."

They do not have a good customer service. They do not do what they say they are going to do and now I\u2019m gonna have to get a lawyer to get my title to my truck released. Please be careful do not get a loan, once you in, you\u2019ll never get out again I have had alone with them for so many years. I\u2019m ashamed of it I should never had to use them.

After talking to her and giving me options somehow Went ahead and accepted the 8.5 thousand loan that she mentioned. Going through the paperwork I don\u2019t remember being told that my interest rate was almost as much as the loan. For a 8.k loan, my interest rate is about 6.2k so after getting the loan I\u2019m now paying back 14,000 opposed to the 8.5. I know interest exists, but 23% is ridiculous. What I will say is if you do this online or over the phone read everything over yourself because they do screen share (with your permission, of course) but don\u2019t allow them to say oh well this screen just tells you xyz and scroll through. No read it yourself because if I would\u2019ve saw that I had to pay back double almost double of what I was getting. I would\u2019ve never signed that loan"

        "reviewDescription": "I asked for the total amount available, as I added another vehicle for collateral, and on top of the money needed I was in negotiations for a deal on some property, so I was going to hold back that money for that land deal. I figured if it didn't work out I could just put it in savings until another deal came up. It would also always be available for emergencies or make extra payments.\nWell when it came to close the loan the gave me 2 choices one for a lesser amount and one for the full amount. The loan for the lesser amount was 2% higher on the interest rate, and I explained my reasoning and then felt pressured to accept the lesser amount and I asked her if I was able to get the land deal negotiated could I come back and get the loan I originally requested and she said, sure it wouldn't be a problem.\nAs soon as I got the land deal worked out. I texted an 812 number that they had contacted me on, when they had an issue depositing the money from the loan for the lesser amount, and requested me come back for a check. Then I had issues with the check at first. But was finally able to cash after a couple hours. So with the branch being closed for a long holiday weekend. I thought the 812 number may be the branch manager so I wanted to let her know right away I needed to change the loan.\nI had put $3300 of the money I just borrowed down to hold the property knowing i could get the remaining $700 from the new loan as well as the money need for the items originally.\nNow she won't refund the money but is allowing me 2 months to come up with remaining money for the property or lose that cash. Now I'm stressed and trying to hustle up to cover all of it. They said the reason for denial was that One Main Financial would like to see me make a payment on a loan first... Are you kidding me 2 loans paid off with minimal issues on my payments. Before they took my other collateral and their Holiday commission, I was a valued customer now I'm treated as a complete stranger and a value to nobody"

It\u2019s still being managed by One Main. I call the company to find out what that\u2019s about because I\u2019m not actually 30 days late.

Unless I want to go back to paying the original amount. So they don\u2019t actually help at all. They didn\u2019t tell me this information when I signed up for the settlement.

They send a prequalified offer of 14.45%. You apply and get approved and guess what it jumps to 18.6% for 5 years. Not bad almost $3500 interest. Not bad for someone that is desperate that is. I asked where the 15.4% I was offered at 60 months. She said hold on and come back and said I can do that at 36 months and your payment go up at almost $100 month. lol. If you\u2019re even semi educated you can see where I\u2019m going with this. Never ever believe those prequalified offers because once you apply you can\u2019t get the inquiry off your credit report even when approved. That my friend is called bait and switch.

Not only that, they callled me countless times per day about being late on my payment, which I was not, and explained to her that it comes out on the 15th of every month which she could see on her system, but she pushed back and continued to be extremely rude without looking at what date my payments came out. After making a payment, my normal payment which I was not behind on, I made an additional $100 payment and they still continued to call me repeatedly. Oone Main responded to my initial review, but took no accountability for their rude employees calling me countless times, all they said was be sure to keep my account current, which it was/is.\n\nAgain, stay away if you can, I made a huge mistake getting a loan with One Main Financial. Seek a company that shows respect to their customers, especially at the interest rates they charge. Again, a big mistake on my end, if I woud have know this is how they would treat me, I would have gone elswhere with my business.

I am handicapped mentally, and physically. I had to let my car go back because the payments were too high. They loaned me $12,000 on it and six months later I had the car appraised at two different car lots and they offered me between $8000 and $9000 to purchase it. It was a 2014 Nissan pathfinder with a brand new $5000 transmission less than six months old. I received a letter from them today saying that sold it at auction for $800\u2026 Ridiculous! I was in the automobile business for 50 years before my wife was murdered and I had to retire.\nI will spend the rest of my days on this earth, telling everyone that gives me two minutes to talk to them.\u2026 To stay away from this company\u2026they lie, and now they are trying to steal from a handicap person by saying my car was worth only $800, I wonder who\u2019s friend bought the car at the auction. If you were done this way by this company too\u2026. Please contact me at my email\u2026\nThere are laws and organizations that will help you and protect us from people like this, and I will put you in contact with them.\nOn May 31, 2023, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) issued an order against OneMain Financial Holdings, LLC; OneMain Financial Group, LLC; OneMain Financial (HI), Inc.; OneMain Financial, Inc.; and OneMain Financial of Minnesota, Inc. (collectively referred to as OneMain). OneMain is an Indiana-based personal loan installment lender with more than 1,400 branches across 44 states. In connection with loan originations and renewals, OneMain markets, sells, and finances add-on products, including credit life insurance, credit disability insurance, and identity theft protection. For several years, OneMain misrepresented to tens of thousands of consumers who purchased and then subsequently canceled optional add-on products that they could cancel the products during what it called a \u201cfull refund period\u201d and be returned to the financial position they would have been in had the product never been added to their loan. The Bureau found that OneMain engaged in deceptive acts or practices in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA) by misleading consumers into believing they must purchase add-on products to receive loans and that they could cancel the add-on products within a prescribed time period without cost. The Bureau also found that OneMain engaged in unfair acts or practices in violation of the CFPA by charging and failing to refund the full premium and interest that accrued on add-on products consumers did not agree to purchase and by charging and failing to refund interest that accrued on add-on product fees during a purported full-refund period. Finally, the Bureau found that OneMain violated the CFPA by abusively interfering with consumers\u2019 ability to understand that add-on products were optional and that OneMain charged non-refundable interest during the purported full-refund period. The order requires OneMain to stop its unlawful activities, adjust its policies to make cancellation of add-on products easier, include interest in refunds after add-on product cancellations, pay at least $10,000,000 in consumer redress, and pay a $10,000,000 civil money penalty. OneMain must also take measures to ensure future compliance."

So now, Credit Karma comes up and tells me I missed a payment when I pay early every month. I'm tired of disputing them constantly because they can't do their job. On top of that they have super high rates around 25%. The person below who commented on their sales practices was 100% correct in what they said. In my case, I was sent an actual notice from them saying I was pre-approved to refinance my loan to get additional cash out. When I filled out additional information, the soft inquiry said I was approved. It literally gave me 8 or 10 offers to choose from. I selected the best offer for me. When I submitted it, a hard inquiry was done, and then they denied me and made my credit score drop. They are a terrible company. I would never do business with them again. I have managed to raise my score a lot on my own. I literally closed every single credit card I had, except for 2. Despite what financial experts tell you, that worked for me. I can't wait to be done with this place.\n\n11/28/2023 - It's funny how in their reply they do not address how they're not reporting my payments or anything regarding their bait and switch sales tactics. I hit the nail on the head. They can't defend their actions."

I went in as asked and was told that Jackson was off that day- there were two womwn there- Mary and Heather- they were very busy but went out of their way to make sure I could be taken care of. They got all of my information and asked if I could come back at 5:15- I did and they were very prompt in helping me. I could not haave asked for better service. The only drawback was that Jackson told me I was approved for 10,000 but I was only allowed 7000. I feel like maybe Jackson needs more training?

My experience working with Naira has been nothing short of excellent, and I believe she truly deserves recognition as a model employee.\n\nNaira's positive attitude throughout the entire process was truly refreshing. It made the often stressful experience of securing a loan significantly more manageable. Her prompt responses to my inquiries demonstrated a high level of professionalism and dedication to customer service. No matter the complexity of my questions, Naira consistently provided thorough and clear answers, instilling confidence in every step of the process.\n\nOne of the standout qualities that I deeply appreciate about Naira is her patience. There were moments when I needed extra time to understand certain aspects of the loan agreement, and Naira was incredibly patient and understanding. This made me feel valued as a client, and I never felt rushed or pressured to make decisions.\n\nFurthermore, Naira's commitment to courtesy and respect was evident throughout our interactions. At no point did she display any hint of rudeness or impatience, even when faced with challenging situations. This level of professionalism and kindness significantly contributed to the overall positive experience I had with your company.\n\nIn summary, Naira C has truly exceeded my expectations as a loan consultant. Her exemplary service, positive demeanor, promptness, patience, and respectful approach make her an outstanding asset to your team. I believe recognizing and acknowledging employees like Naira is essential for fostering a culture of excellence within your organization.\n\nPlease extend my sincerest gratitude to Naira and consider this as a heartfelt shout-out to her exemplary performance.\n\nThank you for maintaining such high standards of customer service.\n\nSincerely,\nEdward A"

Then I get an email about the \u201cclosing\u201d it leaves an address but doesn\u2019t state whether it was a call or an in-person. We went to the address and the man who answered the door was very polite and stated that this dude had an unexpected \u201cemergency\u201d and would have an agent reach out to us.\n\nWe spoke with a fairly new agent Latia and she was AMAZING! Every question we had she answered and every text was responded to in record time. She did such an amazing job and how she was able to gain permission to speak with me because my husband drives for a living and cannot legally be on the phone was something I\u2019ve never seen in a company and I\u2019ve been in banking for over 14 yrs! Plz give her this msg and her kiddos within the building because she set the bar and I\u2019m coming back for multiple other loans if needed. Tysm Latia for leaving that lasting impression, you have a client for life with us! Bravo!!!!"

Yet we only do about 1 a month through them because they are RIDICOLOUS and ask for everything they can think of.\n\nI am talking about birth certificates, socials bill, all bank statements (even though already had paystubs and proof of income wasn't even stated on the main approval!).It seems they want to collect as much unnecessary info as they can on every client they get. Everytime is atleast a 2 day ordeal (latest has taken 3 days), when any other bank takes MINUTES.\n\nOnce they get the buyers on the phone, they throw everything they can at them to get more money for things like gap, roadside etc. And will not take a simple no!\n\nI have been in the car business for 20 years and have sold thousands of cars and we HAVE NEVER dispised a bank as much as this one.

        "reviewDescription": "DO NOT APPLY HERE!! READ BEFORE:\nTLDR: Lies, takes advantage, goes against FCRA & CFPB Regulations !\n\nI am writing this review to express my extreme disappointment and frustration with my recent experience with One Main Financial. I strongly advise against wasting your time applying for a loan with this company, as they will only lead you on and waste your time without any intention of providing the loan they promise.\n\nFrom the very beginning, their representatives gave me false hope and misled me into believing that I was approved for a loan. They assured me that all the information I provided was sufficient for the underwriters and that I would be approved. However, after submitting all the required documents and waiting for two days, I received a call from Carmen, their representative, just before they were about to close. To my shock, she informed me that my loan had been denied, without providing any valid explanation.\n\nI repeatedly asked Carmen for the reasons behind the denial, especially since I had been offered a different loan based on the same information I provided to her. However, she failed to provide any satisfactory answers and seemed completely unaware of the current fair credit reporting act regulations. It is disheartening to see that the supervisors at One Main Financial are also not knowledgeable about these regulations, which are meant to protect consumers.\n\nWhat is even more upsetting is that they do not seem to care about their customers' financial situations, especially during the holiday season. It is distressing to think that lenders like One Main Financial can affect the credit of middle-class individuals through false advertisements and misleading information, all for their own benefit.\n\nI even shared with Carmen my recent hardship, which had caused damage to my home. She seemed sympathetic and excited to provide me with a loan, only to deny me after I had gathered all the necessary documentation. It took me three days to understand the issue, and even after explaining that I am an independent contractor with a stable income, they refused to offer me any alternatives or consider a co-signer. They even assured me that my car could be used as collateral, only to later backtrack on that statement.\n\nFurthermore, it is unacceptable for a lender to inform a potential customer that their 2022 taxes will not negatively impact their loan approval, only to base their decision solely on those tax returns. It is outrageous that a company with a supposedly reputable reputation would rely on outdated methods of income verification, especially during the Covid pandemic. This practice goes against federal regulations for consumer protection and is incredibly unfair and biased.\n\nI am currently working with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and a local professional advocate to hold One Main Financial accountable for their non-compliance with FCRA regulations and the damage they have caused to my already existing hardship. Their actions not only violate regulations but also their own terms and conditions.\n\nI urge anyone considering One Main Financial to save themselves the trouble and learn from my experience. It is best to go somewhere else for your financial needs where you will be treated fairly and with respect.\n\nHappy to answer any and all questions about my experience as i luckily recorded all the interactions via phone with my financial advisor. Please, learn from me. Do not fall for their fake empathy or deceit. If your businesses suffered during the return from 2022, they will judge and discriminate against you based on that. They will NOT care about your 2023 income. They will only pretend to get you in their system to raise their own inquiry numbers."

Luego se hacen la vista gorda para darte respuesta sobre tu peticion de prestamo, dicen que te contactar\u00e1n y lo hacen solamente por unos pocos segundos para decir que te volver\u00e1n a contactar y no lo hacen, fui personalmente a la oficina ubicada en la San Bruno, CA. el trato de las damas ah\u00ed presentes fue muy grosero, con caras de amargadas, poco profesionales con el trato al cliente, despu\u00e9s de un rato me dijeron que me iba a llamar una persona, la cual al llamarme me dijo estas palabras \u201cestoy tomando esta llamada la cual no es de mi incumbencia, si quieres seguir el proceso puedo ayudarte pero r\u00e1pido porque tengo mucho que hacer y esto quita mucho tiempo\u201d le dije bye y colgu\u00e9 la llamada, volv\u00ed a entrar a la oficina y me dijeron que iban a mandar un email a un manager y que esperara otra llamada en los pr\u00f3ximos d\u00edas, ya cancele mi petici\u00f3n y ellos se quedaron con TODA mi informaci\u00f3n. Que har\u00e1n con esa informaci\u00f3n m\u00eda? Sabra Dios. TENGA CUIDADO AL PROPORCIONAR INFORMACI\u00d3N PERSONAL.\n\nENGLISH.\nATTENTION BEWARE! They get all your details, banking information, address, details of your assets, everything! Then they turn a blind eye to give you an answer about your loan request, they say they will contact you and they do it only for a few seconds to say that they will contact you again and they don't, I personally went to the office located in San Bruno, CA. The treatment of the ladies present there was very rude, with bitter faces, unprofessional with customer service, after a while they told me that a person was going to call me, who when calling me said these words \"I am taking this call which is not my concern, if you want to follow the process I can help you but quickly because I have a lot to do and this takes up a lot of time\u201d I said bye and hung up the call, I went back into the office and they told me that they were going to send an email to a manager and to expect another call in the next few days, I already canceled my request and they kept ALL my information. What will they do with that information of mine? God knows. PLEASE BE CAREFUL WHEN PROVIDING PERSONAL INFORMATION."

Been on phone for over an hour trying to cancel 4 ins. 1 exp 2021 home and car ins, we live in OH, its a law to have car ins, we didn't own our home at the time for home ins. We asked for only 1 ins. Now with only 6 payments remaining, yes our fault for not noticing earlier, but their fault for doing this to us. Over $800.00 later, not including the home & car ins. Around last March, don't know why, with good credit, not thinking maybe, no huge car payment like 1st loan, they denied us a $2,000.00 loan. Because I would not hand my paid off car title over to them!! Told us to leave, because I was very, very upset. But now call my phone and my boyfriend's at least 1 a month asking us if we need any extra $$?? That phone call i asked if we both needed to be present to cancel and was told no, by the time it was almost over guess what, he needed to be present, over $5.26 for the Life ins because they took $457.99 and $4.49 Disability because they already have taken the $390.80 that we gave them permission to take out. I don't know, maybe think twice!! I am very, very unhappy and disappointed in One Main!! The $2,000.00 loan, was asked for before I noticed all this insurance nonsense going on!! I have several reviews, also. This is my 1st 1star review!!"

I had previously sent all requested information by email and was told that I was approved for a loan and all I had to do was sign the documents in person to receive my loan.\n\nWhen I arrived, a young gentlemen who I cannot recall his name assisted me. I had requested for the $4,500 loan which I was approved for. I asked to do the 4 year payment plan. The young men who was assisting me then stepped outside of the room we were in and Daniel Solomacha walked in and immediately stated that he is the branch manager and that if he does not approve my loan, I would receive no loan. I then asked Daniel, why am I being told this. And Daniel proceeded to say that the only way he would approve for me to receive the loan is if I lower my loan request and get it for the 3 year payment plan and not the 4 year payment plan.\nI then explained to Daniel that I was very comfortable with my choice and that as an Office Manager who has a solid job, I can afford to make the payments and would like to proceed with my choice of loan and payment plan. Daniel then firmly stated that he would not approve anything if I do not take his choice. Therefore, I was forced to take a lower loan in the amount of $4,000 and the payment plan of 3 years which is what Daniel wanted me to take. I did not want this. I was forced to go with this in order to receive the loan.\n\nThis to me is very disturbing and upsetting. My credit score was looked into when I applied for the loan and clearly who ever ran my credit score, was able to see that I have a 100% payment paid on time score. I also have a solid good paying job. Which is why I was qualified. So I do not understand why I was told by the young man who was assisting me at first, that I qualify for $4,500 and that I have the option of doing a 4 year payment plan or a 3 year payment plan, when that clearly was not an option to me. Daniel, the branch manager, took it upon himself to decide how much of a loan I will take and what the extension of the payment plan I would be taking as well.\n\nI left the location very unsatisfied and very upset with an awful experience from your branch manager. Needless to say, I will never recommend OneMain Financial to anyone.\n\nDaniel Solomacha is an entitled rude individual who will force you to take whatever loan he finds more suitable for to him rather then allow the customer to make their own choice, or else he will not approve you for a loan if you do not take what he is forcing on to you."

        "reviewDescription": "The worst customer service. They lie. They\u2019re to busy to help you because they were remodeling the office in New Port Richey and working out of Clearwater. They\u2019re overwhelmed and will let you know that you\u2019re a burden. Let me start with I have good credit and have had three loans with One Main. All paid on time and loans paid off early. I applied and spoke to a Vernisha. She called me and I was approved not for the 20,000 I asked for but for 10,000. After that I couldn\u2019t get her on the phone to help with the process. I called three different times just for her to respond with a text to only ask question on the text. She had no time to help so she put me to the local branch in New Port Richey. That was a Sunday. Monday I heard nothing. Tuesday I called spoke with a Jason and he said I we will have you closed out by tomorrow and you will here from me by the end of the day today or first thing in the morning. No call at all. Wednesday nothing. So I called and left a message at lunch time. Nothing back again. Thursday called and left a message at lunch. Nothing back again. So I decided to go into the local office after work at 5 pm to see what\u2019s going on and if I can help the process since I have already be approved no going on almost two weeks. I spoke to one girl at the desk and told her what was going on and she let me know how over whelmed they are and someone will be with me shortly. Then the branch manager Sean came over and asked me what was going on. I explained it all over again. He seem to be annoyed that I was annoyed with the lack of customer service. he then went to his computer punched a couple keys sat there for five minutes and came back and said I\u2019m sorry we can\u2019t approve you for anything at this time.now if that was the case all of this could of been settled on that first call. But it wasn\u2019t. He was rude and annoyed because I came in without an appointment. I feel he made an executive decision to send me on my way instead of trying to help. Straight BS. Horrible customer service. The company thrives on speed and you can have a 550 credit score and still get approved. BS because my score is way higher than that and I was approved on the first phone call. All other loans were done within 24 to 48 hours. Now I sent an email about the situation and their email response said if I need immediate attention that I need to call them. Again Lack of customer service. Again straight BS."

I am a long time customer, have paid off a large loan with OMG and currently have an unsecured credit card with the company. When I complained about being treated this way I was told there was a miscommunication about my appointment time and they are human and allowed to make mistakes. Completely unacceptable. Good payment history and history with this company clearly mean nothing. Why am I being solicited with offers and asked to select my loan terms if they have no intention of following through but more importantly why give a final approval and schedule a closing just to jerk someone around? Be very careful with this discriminating company that scams customers."

Minutes later, a gentleman called and directed me that the loan was secured and they were unable to proceed. This was AFTER OMF ran my credit. I understood a credit check was necessary, but had I been informed through the process that my loan would be switched from unsecured to secured, I would not have allowed them to run my credit. Very \"bait and switch\" after all expectations and communication stated unsecured. I was connected with \"customer care\" and was told there's nothing they can do, and \"this just happens\".

Dalton was more professional but wasn't able to help.\nOnemain financial filed a loan application without my permission.\nAfter filing a complaint with my attorney generals office, on 10-30-2023 onemain financial blatantly lied in their claim that I was offered a loan at all. Much less specifically a secured loan for 4,000 as I was not offered a loan at all.\nIf onemain financial blatantly lies about a NONE CUSTOMER financial information, I would not personally trust with with access to your bank account, home or car."

The estimated cost for your registration comes in at $200 more. Also we did this loan to payoff a loan my wife had prior to our marriage. We were quoted the pay off amount closed on the loan and then was told oh there was a payment we processed to include in loan. Lastly One main is refusing to provide my loan documents so I can review the loan in its entirety."

Then the website seemingly glitched and wouldn\u2019t allow my husband to sign his part. So they came back saying they needed identity verification, so we uploaded more documents, answered more questions, etc. All this time Brittany keeps saying \u201cI\u2019ll call you back in the morning\u201d, \u201cI\u2019ll call you back in a little bit\u201d, and hours would pass by with no call or update until I would call and ask. Finally after hours and hours over this week of trying to get this loan to finish closing, I call for an update and am told they decided not to move forward. Brittany didn\u2019t even bother to call and tell me.
