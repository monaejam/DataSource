We were very unsure about the loan because of previous bad experience with One Main Financial, but she was honest and professional from the beginning and answered all of our questions perfectly and put our minds at ease! Y'all need more reps like her. Because your business depends on it. People will not go into business with Rude untrustworthy employees. Thank you Wendy for all your help!!",

She did not have anything prepared with my insurance company but complained about how difficult they were to work with. She did not tell me that I would have to call and have them send her things so I could have the loan processed. Because we had to do all of this, and she did not have it set up I was over 40 min late getting back to work. So, I called her the next day to ask her some questions and she was very short and rude and hung up on me.

  "reviewDescription": "Absolutely horrible customer service. I received my credit card and activated it. The website would not let me log in. I went to reset my password and received an email that my account was locked and that I would need to call Customer Service. I called and listened to their garbage automated phone system that would not recognize voice commands (as they said it would) and none of the options listed by the phone system provided anything remotely related to unlocking an account. The automated phone system eventually hung up on me. When I called back again, I just picked an option hoping the Customer Service Representative would be able to transfer me to the correct person. My call was answered by someone with a very thick Indian accent that had me verify my account information. She was able to transfer me to someone who could reset my account, but I had to wait on hold for a very long time.

  "reviewDescription": "There is NO WAY One Main has a TrustPilot rating this high. Most people I know who have used them have had SOME issue with them.\n\nI had a loan with them in 2021 for about $5k. I paid it off in 6 months by coincidence because my VA case settled and I received a large sum of money.\n\nFast forward to today, I was looking at my credit report and noticed that in my Transunion section, they remarked my loan with them as “ Canceled by credit grantor”. Might seem benign right? CANCELED is not typically used on loans that have been paid off correctly. CANCELED by credit grantor is often associated with something bad on your credit report. These little details matter.\n\nI disputed it and of course, they couldn’t change it. What is an absolute minor detail for them, and a major one for me, they couldn’t change.\n\nDO NOT GO WITH ONE MAIN. Their entire business model is designed around enslaving desperate people into loans with excruciatingly high interest that you will never be able to pay off. And if you do pay it off, they will get their last lick by reflecting it poorly on your credit.\n\nAgain, these amount of positive reviews have GOT TO BE PAID.\n\nEDIT FOR FUTURE VIEWERS: NOTICE how they took the time to respond to the claim of paid reviews, but could give FK all about their mishandling of my credit report? You see what you will deal with now?\n",

  "reviewDescription": "I needed my loan ASAP and I still haven’t received it. I was supposed to get it last Wednesday and it was not deposited into my account. After 3 days of waiting, they told me I can pick up a check in person. I picked up the check and went to the bank to deposit it and it still has a hold on it until the 24th. I needed the funds to fix my car. We are in a worse situation now because we haven’t been able to pay for the repairs on my car so they are still holding it until I am able to pay to pick it up. So it’s been very hard on us financially not being able to get to work and having to take a Lyft every day to and from work. Very unreliable. When I signed the loan agreement over a week ago, I was told it would be deposited into my checking account the next day and when it wasn’t, they made me wait 3 days…. Even though they got a message saying there was an error depositing the funds into my account. And now I’m still waiting because the check hasn’t cleared with my bank yet…..",

  "reviewDescription": "Any car loan that has a 20% interest rate is insane. The location I bought the car from only offered OneMain Financial auto financing, and so I bought the car on a Saturday, and re-financed Monday morning with a 5.9% interest rate. I would never recommend OneMain Financial to anyone...to me, it is the Pawn Shop or Pay Day Loans of auto financing. (I must admit I laughed at the reply to this post from OneMain...apparently a credit score of 784 and a very good income means a 20% interest rate is justified. Hilarious! The bank I re-financed with were shocked at such an absurd interest rate. Do your homework!)",

  "reviewDescription": "Applied for a loan and was turned down due to 1. Limited Credit File and 2. No credit file. I have 40+ years of credit and perfect payments for over 20+ years and have Good credit and do not need to fix it. Called to talk to someone about it in Tucson Arizona at 6781 N Thornydale Rd. #243 Tucson AZ. I believe the person was named \"Jackie\", not sure. I told her what happened and even mentioned I had taken out a loan last year at that location and even paid it off early. She told me yep that's what happens, made it very clear she was not interested in looking at the situation or helping me at all. I was made offers by several other companies but wanted to do business with this one since everything went very smooth the last time. I know there had to have been a glitch since the system was having problems recognizing my social security number for my account but they obviously do not care and assume that anyone calling about being rejected must automatically have bad credit. I do not usually respond to things but the person was so quick to get rid of me on the phone and not wanting to hear anything more I felt it needed to be addressed. Not that missing out on my business will make a difference to a company this size.",

  "reviewDescription": "I was disappointed by the fact I got approved online for a $8000 unsecured loan but when I got to the office and was about to fill out the paperwork they dropped it down to $4000. I was not given an explanation that made sense to why it was dropped so low. I then referred my boyfriend to see what they would offer him and also it was $4000. I just don’t understand how we both got offered a $4000 loan with different credit scores. I don’t know if that’s the limit if it’s unsecured but if so that should have been stated. I would like to say the customer service was fast and they got me in right away.",

Also, payment options are super slim to adding your bank account details, what if I just want ro process a debit transaction.. that's A no... Not sure about all the other super extra positive reviews but this is my honest opinion/ review.. This company as a whole can really do better starting with there customer service PLEASE. We should not be on hold the same length as a work shift just to get simple help. Because everything in the App points you to call and sir on hold but in return receive little to no help.\n\nMy biggest mistake.",

The last payment on my loan they didn’t take the proper amount, the payment left a balance of 24 cents. So instead of making an automatic payment of 24 cents the next month they didn’t do anything, didn’t contact me, nothing. Then the following month they reported my account as delinquent to the credit bureaus, really messing up my credit score. For 24 cents!!!!! I will never understand why they didn’t adjust the last payment 24 cents higher to pay off the loan totally, or at least contact me in some manner regarding the 24 cent balance. The only way I discovered this was a notification from a credit bureau saying I had a delinquent account and my credit score had gone down. Seriously!! Based on my experience I would never use this company ever. Borrower beware!!",

The insurance company made the FULL payments, but OneMain continued to also pull it from my account.\nI am currently paid ahead until March 1st.\nThis morning I spoke to find ANOTHER $285.50 taken from my account even though my online account and statement both state I'm paid ahead until 3/1/24. This payment they took today caused my electric bill to bounce. I'm completely disabled and have a small child, and they won't give me the money back. They have taken $856 out of my account since October that wasn't owed to them. DO NOT USE THIS LOAN COMPANY. THEY ARE THIEVES!!!!!!!!",

I think it's BS, and if I had it to do over, I wouldn't use them, I'd look elsewhere, and you should too. UPDATE!! One Main asked me to call them, I did, and I discovered that 1. Being an existing customer with on time payment history DOESN'T MATTER to them. 2. Your application isn't even checked by a real person, a computer makes the final decision. Just wondering if my AGE is a factor...hmmm Stay far far away from doing business with this company. Update #2.. more BS, they acknowledged that I have a perfect payment history, not only with them but my other accounts, but their \"computer said I was some sort of risk.

Sometimes my payments might be a week or 2 late but I am a repeat customer for several loans and always paid them off.\nIn Colorado Springs the branch at Austin bluffs is terrible. They will hassle you after normal business hours, calling from several different numbers. They dont leave voicemails or messages or emails. They never call you to make payment arrangements but they call wanting you to just make a payment instead.\nCathy is beyond rude and shouldnt be working in customer service. I had to call them after hours and basically yell at them to quit calling my phone 4 to 6 times daily...now they only call me twice a day but it is always after 6pm cause they think I am home.\nOnce my loan is paid off I will never use One Main again.

  "reviewDescription": "I requested to borrow $4,000 and it showed that I was approved but when the person called me, she was talking about needing collateral. To get the collateral, I would have to borrow enough to pay off my car (approx $8,000) and then use my car as collateral for the $4,000 that I needed. So basically, you're asking me to borrow $12,000 for the sake of needing $4,000. To best is that the interest rate on the $8,000 to pay off my car would be higher than the interest rate I'm paying now on the car loan! Nothing but a money-grubbing scam ... would not recommend them to anyone!",

  "reviewDescription": "I have decided to change my earlier review that I had previously left. My wife and I were approved for a loan amount of $12,368 based on the value of my wife's car. As part of the loan process, One Main requested that a loan to Wells Fargo issued in my name which I was not keen on doing. Supposedly, a check was mailed to Wells Fargo in the amount of $3,939.00 to pay off loan. As of today (01/13/2024), the check has not been received by Wells Fargo. One Main Financial has offered every excuse in the world to say that the check was indeed mailed on 12/28/2023. They have even claimed that Wells Fargo may be holding the check to make sure it is a good check. Even if that is so, the time for that to have occurred has already passed by. One Main Financial has refused to do anything except make sure that I will make their payment on the designated due date. i have contacted Wells Fargo to be on the lookout for the check. One Main Financial should step up and do a thorough investigation into where the check is. The check has surely have had enough time to be posted to my account at Wells Fargo. One Main has stated that their check writing company has confirmed and has offered to do a stop payment on the check after 30 days. That act would mean that I will have to make another installment payment to Wells Fargo plus make two payments to One Main Financial during that same thirty day period. That suggestion is ludicrous.",

I was told they don't look at your credit which mine is fair. I was told a family member could use their vehicle as collateral but I wasn't told over several weeks that the vehicle must be paid off if loan amount small. I don't consider $5,000 to be a small amount but that's what was still owed on the vehicle. I feel like Jason dropped the ball and wasn't honest from the beginning. We were not approved for a loan so that's it but it would have been nice to know this weeks ago. They act like it's easy and anybody can get a loan but that's not true.",

They do not have a good customer service. They do not do what they say they are going to do and now I’m gonna have to get a lawyer to get my title to my truck released. Please be careful do not get a loan, once you in, you’ll never get out again I have had alone with them for so many years. I’m ashamed of it I should never had to use them. I hope that someone will think before they take along with these people. Please be careful.",

I'm on the \"Do Not Call\" federal registry and have even reported their spam calls on the federal website and still get spam.\n\nDo not support companies that propagate these practices.

I transferred my business to the OneMain Financial in Grayson, Georgia and me and my wife dealt with Summer☀️ who was a complete delight she did everything she said she would do, she followed through, no matter what her circumstances was she took care of her customer, which made a world a difference to me and my wife anyone who knows me knows that I am the nicest guy in the world but when I know someone is lying to me I will call them out on that , my business will forever be with Summer☀️ at the Grayson Georgia location.

  "reviewDescription": "OK to start this off. This has nothing to do with the lady that helped me out with the loan. She was great she was nice I just feel like I was a little deceived. I got a loan back in the end of May beginning of June 2023 I initially reached out for a $5000 loan. After talking to her and giving me options somehow Went ahead and accepted the 8.5 thousand loan that she mentioned. Going through the paperwork I don’t remember being told that my interest rate was almost as much as the loan. For a 8.k loan, my interest rate is about 6.2k so after getting the loan I’m now paying back 14,000 opposed to the 8.5. I know interest exists, but 23% is ridiculous. What I will say is if you do this online or over the phone read everything over yourself because they do screen share (with your permission, of course) but don’t allow them to say oh well this screen just tells you xyz and scroll through. No read it yourself because if I would’ve saw that I had to pay back double almost double of what I was getting. I would’ve never signed that loan",

  "reviewDescription": "I asked for the total amount available, as I added another vehicle for collateral, and on top of the money needed I was in negotiations for a deal on some property, so I was going to hold back that money for that land deal. I figured if it didn't work out I could just put it in savings until another deal came up. It would also always be available for emergencies or make extra payments.\nWell when it came to close the loan the gave me 2 choices one for a lesser amount and one for the full amount. The loan for the lesser amount was 2% higher on the interest rate, and I explained my reasoning and then felt pressured to accept the lesser amount and I asked her if I was able to get the land deal negotiated could I come back and get the loan I originally requested and she said, sure it wouldn't be a problem.\nAs soon as I got the land deal worked out. I texted an 812 number that they had contacted me on, when they had an issue depositing the money from the loan for the lesser amount, and requested me come back for a check. Then I had issues with the check at first. But was finally able to cash after a couple hours. So with the branch being closed for a long holiday weekend. I thought the 812 number may be the branch manager so I wanted to let her know right away I needed to change the loan.\nI had put $3300 of the money I just borrowed down to hold the property knowing i could get the remaining $700 from the new loan as well as the money need for the items originally.\nNow she won't refund the money but is allowing me 2 months to come up with remaining money for the property or lose that cash. Now I'm stressed and trying to hustle up to cover all of it. They said the reason for denial was that One Main Financial would like to see me make a payment on a loan first... Are you kidding me 2 loans paid off with minimal issues on my payments. Before they took my other collateral and their Holiday commission, I was a valued customer now I'm treated as a complete stranger and a value to nobody",

They told me yes and got me all set up, I made the first payment right away. Well apparently they don’t actually update anything in their system and so 30 days later I find a late payment ding on my credit report. The only thing they actually updated was to make sure and put on my credit report they the account is being managed through a debt settlement company. Which it’s not. It’s still being managed by One Main. I call the company to find out what that’s about because I’m not actually 30 days late. They told me nothing actually changes in the system and that yes every month I don’t make the initial agreed upon payment I will get a late payment ding on my credit report. Unless I want to go back to paying the original amount. So they don’t actually help at all. They didn’t tell me this information when I signed up for the settlement. Just let me go ahead and take the hit and then tell me there’s nothing they can do for me. The local office never answers their phone or returns phone calls. Don’t take any loans from\nThis company unless you want to be paying them for the rest of forever. They’ve already made plenty of money off of me. Disgusting.",

Yes I was approved. I have an average credit score of 750 with no late payments or defaults in loans and credit cards. They send a prequalified offer of 14.45%. You apply and get approved and guess what it jumps to 18.6% for 5 years. Not bad almost $3500 interest. Not bad for someone that is desperate that is. I asked where the 15.4% I was offered at 60 months. She said hold on and come back and said I can do that at 36 months and your payment go up at almost $100 month. lol. If you’re even semi educated you can see where I’m going with this. Never ever believe those prequalified offers because once you apply you can’t get the inquiry off your credit report even when approved. That my friend is called bait and switch. You know who you are. I seen her name in a couple of negative reviews.",

  "reviewDescription": "Stay away from One Main Financial, the customer service people are some of the most rude and condescending people I have ever interacted with. Even when I made multiple payments they still call non-stop. The last young lady was beyond rude when she asked me about surrendering my car for a payment of $123. Not only that, they callled me countless times per day about being late on my payment, which I was not, and explained to her that it comes out on the 15th of every month which she could see on her system, but she pushed back and continued to be extremely rude without looking at what date my payments came out. After making a payment, my normal payment which I was not behind on, I made an additional $100 payment and they still continued to call me repeatedly. Oone Main responded to my initial review, but took no accountability for their rude employees calling me countless times, all they said was be sure to keep my account current, which it was/is.\n\nAgain, stay away if you can, I made a huge mistake getting a loan with One Main Financial. Seek a company that shows respect to their customers, especially at the interest rates they charge. Again, a big mistake on my end, if I woud have know this is how they would treat me, I would have gone elswhere with my business. I will never again do business with the most rude and unprofessional One Main Financial. I hope this helps someone to avoid what I have experienced!",

  "reviewDescription": "This company lied to me. Two weeks after I took out a loan on my car. I wanted to cancel gap insurance… They said I could not. It’s against company policy. I am handicapped mentally, and physically. I had to let my car go back because the payments were too high. They loaned me $12,000 on it and six months later I had the car appraised at two different car lots and they offered me between $8000 and $9000 to purchase it. It was a 2014 Nissan pathfinder with a brand new $5000 transmission less than six months old. I received a letter from them today saying that sold it at auction for $800… Ridiculous! I was in the automobile business for 50 years before my wife was murdered and I had to retire.\nI will spend the rest of my days on this earth, telling everyone that gives me two minutes to talk to them.… To stay away from this company…they lie, and now they are trying to steal from a handicap person by saying my car was worth only $800, I wonder who’s friend bought the car at the auction. If you were done this way by this company too…. Please contact me at my email…\nThere are laws and organizations that will help you and protect us from people like this, and I will put you in contact with them.\nOn May 31, 2023, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) issued an order against OneMain Financial Holdings, LLC; OneMain Financial Group, LLC; OneMain Financial (HI), Inc.; OneMain Financial, Inc.; and OneMain Financial of Minnesota, Inc. (collectively referred to as OneMain). OneMain is an Indiana-based personal loan installment lender with more than 1,400 branches across 44 states. In connection with loan originations and renewals, OneMain markets, sells, and finances add-on products, including credit life insurance, credit disability insurance, and identity theft protection. For several years, OneMain misrepresented to tens of thousands of consumers who purchased and then subsequently canceled optional add-on products that they could cancel the products during what it called a “full refund period” and be returned to the financial position they would have been in had the product never been added to their loan. The Bureau found that OneMain engaged in deceptive acts or practices in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA) by misleading consumers into believing they must purchase add-on products to receive loans and that they could cancel the add-on products within a prescribed time period without cost. The Bureau also found that OneMain engaged in unfair acts or practices in violation of the CFPA by charging and failing to refund the full premium and interest that accrued on add-on products consumers did not agree to purchase and by charging and failing to refund interest that accrued on add-on product fees during a purported full-refund period. Finally, the Bureau found that OneMain violated the CFPA by abusively interfering with consumers’ ability to understand that add-on products were optional and that OneMain charged non-refundable interest during the purported full-refund period. The order requires OneMain to stop its unlawful activities, adjust its policies to make cancellation of add-on products easier, include interest in refunds after add-on product cancellations, pay at least $10,000,000 in consumer redress, and pay a $10,000,000 civil money penalty. OneMain must also take measures to ensure future compliance.",

I actively have two car loans that I’m paying and I’ve never paid them late but for some reason this company won’t approve me for a loan even know they gave me an excellent chance of approval. I will no longer do business with this company or refer anyone to them. Plz save your time and look for a loan somewhere else.",

  "reviewDescription": "I received an automated message that I had good approval odds through One Main.\n\nI applied online and saw the note saying I would only have a soft credit pull. I was given the option of a secured and unsecured loan online. All seemed good until I applied, the credit pull was a hard pull, and after getting a message of approval of the loan with the hard credit pull I was told I would need to provide info for a secured loan.\n\nI scheduled a call which never came, called them myself and was asked to provide all the same info again. I was told that there may not be offers for me and was still asked to provide vehicle info after I stated I did not want a secured loan.\n\nThe process was really frustrating and on top of everything I now have a hard credit pull and nothing to show from it.\n\nI feel tricked, as the initial online info was much different, just looking for a way to consolidate debt. I would have been fine if they just gave me this info up front rather than changing info throughout the process.",

  "reviewDescription": "They are not a good company to do business with. One issue is that they do not report the payments you make as they should. My credit reports show nothing past May 2023. When I disputed this, they updated June & July with \"-\". Here it is 6 months later, and they haven't updated anything. So now, Credit Karma comes up and tells me I missed a payment when I pay early every month. I'm tired of disputing them constantly because they can't do their job. On top of that they have super high rates around 25%. The person below who commented on their sales practices was 100% correct in what they said. In my case, I was sent an actual notice from them saying I was pre-approved to refinance my loan to get additional cash out. When I filled out additional information, the soft inquiry said I was approved. It literally gave me 8 or 10 offers to choose from. I selected the best offer for me. When I submitted it, a hard inquiry was done, and then they denied me and made my credit score drop. They are a terrible company. I would never do business with them again. I have managed to raise my score a lot on my own. I literally closed every single credit card I had, except for 2. Despite what financial experts tell you, that worked for me. I can't wait to be done with this place.\n\n11/28/2023 - It's funny how in their reply they do not address how they're not reporting my payments or anything regarding their bait and switch sales tactics. I hit the nail on the head. They can't defend their actions.",

Thank you OneMain. And thank you Jocelyn at Parmer on the Creek.",

I went in as asked and was told that Jackson was off that day- there were two womwn there- Mary and Heather- they were very busy but went out of their way to make sure I could be taken care of. They got all of my information and asked if I could come back at 5:15- I did and they were very prompt in helping me. I could not haave asked for better service. The only drawback was that Jackson told me I was approved for 10,000 but I was only allowed 7000. I feel like maybe Jackson needs more training?

She said they hadn't made a discussion if it would be waved. I just went ahead and paid it I NEVER want to do business with them as long as I live.

My experience working with Naira has been nothing short of excellent, and I believe she truly deserves recognition as a model employee.\n\nNaira's positive attitude throughout the entire process was truly refreshing. It made the often stressful experience of securing a loan significantly more manageable. Her prompt responses to my inquiries demonstrated a high level of professionalism and dedication to customer service. No matter the complexity of my questions, Naira consistently provided thorough and clear answers, instilling confidence in every step of the process.\n\nOne of the standout qualities that I deeply appreciate about Naira is her patience. There were moments when I needed extra time to understand certain aspects of the loan agreement, and Naira was incredibly patient and understanding. This made me feel valued as a client, and I never felt rushed or pressured to make decisions.\n\nFurthermore, Naira's commitment to courtesy and respect was evident throughout our interactions. At no point did she display any hint of rudeness or impatience, even when faced with challenging situations. This level of professionalism and kindness significantly contributed to the overall positive experience I had with your company.\n\nIn summary, Naira C has truly exceeded my expectations as a loan consultant. Her exemplary service, positive demeanor, promptness, patience, and respectful approach make her an outstanding asset to your team. I believe recognizing and acknowledging employees like Naira is essential for fostering a culture of excellence within your organization.\n\nPlease extend my sincerest gratitude to Naira and consider this as a heartfelt shout-out to her exemplary performance.\n\nThank you for maintaining such high standards of customer service.\n\nSincerely,\nEdward A",

Every question we had she answered and every text was responded to in record time. She did such an amazing job and how she was able to gain permission to speak with me because my husband drives for a living and cannot legally be on the phone was something I’ve never seen in a company and I’ve been in banking for over 14 yrs!

Everytime is atleast a 2 day ordeal (latest has taken 3 days), when any other bank takes MINUTES.\n\nOnce they get the buyers on the phone, they throw everything they can at them to get more money for things like gap, roadside etc. And will not take a simple no!\n\nI have been in the car business for 20 years and have sold thousands of cars and we HAVE NEVER dispised a bank as much as this one.

  "reviewTitle": "Lies, takes advantage, goes against FCRA & CFPB Regulations !",
  "reviewDescription": "DO NOT APPLY HERE!! READ BEFORE:\nTLDR: Lies, takes advantage, goes against FCRA & CFPB Regulations !\n\nI am writing this review to express my extreme disappointment and frustration with my recent experience with One Main Financial. I strongly advise against wasting your time applying for a loan with this company, as they will only lead you on and waste your time without any intention of providing the loan they promise.\n\nFrom the very beginning, their representatives gave me false hope and misled me into believing that I was approved for a loan. They assured me that all the information I provided was sufficient for the underwriters and that I would be approved. However, after submitting all the required documents and waiting for two days, I received a call from Carmen, their representative, just before they were about to close. To my shock, she informed me that my loan had been denied, without providing any valid explanation.\n\nI repeatedly asked Carmen for the reasons behind the denial, especially since I had been offered a different loan based on the same information I provided to her. However, she failed to provide any satisfactory answers and seemed completely unaware of the current fair credit reporting act regulations. It is disheartening to see that the supervisors at One Main Financial are also not knowledgeable about these regulations, which are meant to protect consumers.\n\nWhat is even more upsetting is that they do not seem to care about their customers' financial situations, especially during the holiday season. It is distressing to think that lenders like One Main Financial can affect the credit of middle-class individuals through false advertisements and misleading information, all for their own benefit.\n\nI even shared with Carmen my recent hardship, which had caused damage to my home. She seemed sympathetic and excited to provide me with a loan, only to deny me after I had gathered all the necessary documentation. It took me three days to understand the issue, and even after explaining that I am an independent contractor with a stable income, they refused to offer me any alternatives or consider a co-signer. They even assured me that my car could be used as collateral, only to later backtrack on that statement.\n\nFurthermore, it is unacceptable for a lender to inform a potential customer that their 2022 taxes will not negatively impact their loan approval, only to base their decision solely on those tax returns. It is outrageous that a company with a supposedly reputable reputation would rely on outdated methods of income verification, especially during the Covid pandemic. This practice goes against federal regulations for consumer protection and is incredibly unfair and biased.\n\nI am currently working with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and a local professional advocate to hold One Main Financial accountable for their non-compliance with FCRA regulations and the damage they have caused to my already existing hardship. Their actions not only violate regulations but also their own terms and conditions.\n\nI urge anyone considering One Main Financial to save themselves the trouble and learn from my experience. It is best to go somewhere else for your financial needs where you will be treated fairly and with respect.\n\nHappy to answer any and all questions about my experience as i luckily recorded all the interactions via phone with my financial advisor. Please, learn from me. Do not fall for their fake empathy or deceit. If your businesses suffered during the return from 2022, they will judge and discriminate against you based on that. They will NOT care about your 2023 income. They will only pretend to get you in their system to raise their own inquiry numbers.",

Que harán con esa información mía? Sabra Dios. TENGA CUIDADO AL PROPORCIONAR INFORMACIÓN PERSONAL.\n\nENGLISH.\nATTENTION BEWARE! They get all your details, banking information, address, details of your assets, everything! Then they turn a blind eye to give you an answer about your loan request, they say they will contact you and they do it only for a few seconds to say that they will contact you again and they don't, I personally went to the office located in San Bruno, CA. The treatment of the ladies present there was very rude, with bitter faces, unprofessional with customer service, after a while they told me that a person was going to call me, who when calling me said these words \"I am taking this call which is not my concern, if you want to follow the process I can help you but quickly because I have a lot to do and this takes up a lot of time” I said bye and hung up the call, I went back into the office and they told me that they were going to send an email to a manager and to expect another call in the next few days, I already canceled my request and they kept ALL my information.

Now with only 6 payments remaining, yes our fault for not noticing earlier, but their fault for doing this to us. Over $800.00 later, not including the home & car ins. Around last March, don't know why, with good credit, not thinking maybe, no huge car payment like 1st loan, they denied us a $2,000.00 loan. Because I would not hand my paid off car title over to them!! Told us to leave, because I was very, very upset. But now call my phone and my boyfriend's at least 1 a month asking us if we need any extra $$?? That phone call i asked if we both needed to be present to cancel and was told no, by the time it was almost over guess what, he needed to be present, over $5.26 for the Life ins because they took $457.99 and $4.49 Disability because they already have taken the $390.80 that we gave them permission to take out. I don't know, maybe think twice!! I am very, very unhappy and disappointed in One Main!! The $2,000.00 loan, was asked for before I noticed all this insurance nonsense going on!! I have several reviews, also. This is my 1st 1star review!!",

  "reviewDescription": "On Wednesday, November 22nd. I went to OneMain Financial located at 2419 W. Jeffereson St. Joliet IL. 60435. I had previously sent all requested information by email and was told that I was approved for a loan and all I had to do was sign the documents in person to receive my loan.\n\nWhen I arrived, a young gentlemen who I cannot recall his name assisted me. I had requested for the $4,500 loan which I was approved for. I asked to do the 4 year payment plan. The young men who was assisting me then stepped outside of the room we were in and Daniel Solomacha walked in and immediately stated that he is the branch manager and that if he does not approve my loan, I would receive no loan. I then asked Daniel, why am I being told this. And Daniel proceeded to say that the only way he would approve for me to receive the loan is if I lower my loan request and get it for the 3 year payment plan and not the 4 year payment plan.\nI then explained to Daniel that I was very comfortable with my choice and that as an Office Manager who has a solid job, I can afford to make the payments and would like to proceed with my choice of loan and payment plan. Daniel then firmly stated that he would not approve anything if I do not take his choice. Therefore, I was forced to take a lower loan in the amount of $4,000 and the payment plan of 3 years which is what Daniel wanted me to take. I did not want this. I was forced to go with this in order to receive the loan.\n\nThis to me is very disturbing and upsetting. My credit score was looked into when I applied for the loan and clearly who ever ran my credit score, was able to see that I have a 100% payment paid on time score. I also have a solid good paying job. Which is why I was qualified. So I do not understand why I was told by the young man who was assisting me at first, that I qualify for $4,500 and that I have the option of doing a 4 year payment plan or a 3 year payment plan, when that clearly was not an option to me. Daniel, the branch manager, took it upon himself to decide how much of a loan I will take and what the extension of the payment plan I would be taking as well.\n\nI left the location very unsatisfied and very upset with an awful experience from your branch manager. Needless to say, I will never recommend OneMain Financial to anyone.\n\nDaniel Solomacha is an entitled rude individual who will force you to take whatever loan he finds more suitable for to him rather then allow the customer to make their own choice, or else he will not approve you for a loan if you do not take what he is forcing on to you.",

  "reviewDescription": "The worst customer service. They lie. They’re to busy to help you because they were remodeling the office in New Port Richey and working out of Clearwater. They’re overwhelmed and will let you know that you’re a burden. Let me start with I have good credit and have had three loans with One Main. All paid on time and loans paid off early. I applied and spoke to a Vernisha. She called me and I was approved not for the 20,000 I asked for but for 10,000. After that I couldn’t get her on the phone to help with the process. I called three different times just for her to respond with a text to only ask question on the text. She had no time to help so she put me to the local branch in New Port Richey. That was a Sunday. Monday I heard nothing. Tuesday I called spoke with a Jason and he said I we will have you closed out by tomorrow and you will here from me by the end of the day today or first thing in the morning. No call at all. Wednesday nothing. So I called and left a message at lunch time. Nothing back again. Thursday called and left a message at lunch. Nothing back again. So I decided to go into the local office after work at 5 pm to see what’s going on and if I can help the process since I have already be approved no going on almost two weeks. I spoke to one girl at the desk and told her what was going on and she let me know how over whelmed they are and someone will be with me shortly. Then the branch manager Sean came over and asked me what was going on. I explained it all over again. He seem to be annoyed that I was annoyed with the lack of customer service. he then went to his computer punched a couple keys sat there for five minutes and came back and said I’m sorry we can’t approve you for anything at this time.now if that was the case all of this could of been settled on that first call. But it wasn’t. He was rude and annoyed because I came in without an appointment. I feel he made an executive decision to send me on my way instead of trying to help. Straight BS. Horrible customer service. The company thrives on speed and you can have a 550 credit score and still get approved. BS because my score is way higher than that and I was approved on the first phone call. All other loans were done within 24 to 48 hours. Now I sent an email about the situation and their email response said if I need immediate attention that I need to call them. Again Lack of customer service. Again straight BS.",

I submitted all documents and was contacted with a final approval that had been blessed by underwriting as they had to obtain the value of my collateral. I was given a closing appointment and on the day I was scheduled I called 30 min prior and asked if I could go to the location 20 min from me rather than a branch an hour away and two min before my closing appt I was contacted and told never mind they can’t use my collateral, despite the fact that the website says they accept it as collateral and underwriting approved it. I am a long time customer, have paid off a large loan with OMG and currently have an unsecured credit card with the company. When I complained about being treated this way I was told there was a miscommunication about my appointment time and they are human and allowed to make mistakes. Completely unacceptable. Good payment history and history with this company clearly mean nothing. Why am I being solicited with offers and asked to select my loan terms if they have no intention of following through but more importantly why give a final approval and schedule a closing just to jerk someone around? Be very careful with this discriminating company that scams customers.",

Minutes later, a gentleman called and directed me that the loan was secured and they were unable to proceed. This was AFTER OMF ran my credit. I understood a credit check was necessary, but had I been informed through the process that my loan would be switched from unsecured to secured, I would not have allowed them to run my credit.

We live about 2&1/2 hours from the hospital and barely have enough money for gas not to mention something to eat while I am driving back and forth every day. I wish someone had a solution to my situation because it’s extremely difficult for me to continue going back and forth daily that is 5 hours of highway time every day with the money sitting there in a check that I cannot access without her present yet the doctor said she is going to have to be there for at least another week.

I was also laughed at when I mentioned filing with my AG by the first employee. Dalton was more professional but wasn't able to help.\nOnemain financial filed a loan application without my permission.\nAfter filing a complaint with my attorney generals office, on 10-30-2023 onemain financial blatantly lied in their claim that I was offered a loan at all. Much less specifically a secured loan for 4,000 as I was not offered a loan at all.\nIf onemain financial blatantly lies about a NONE CUSTOMER financial information, I would not personally trust with with access to your bank account, home or car.",

However, Shelia did not care to mention that given the changes I would be limited to xyz and just did what she was asked and was later told I would not be able to change my payment date due to this which I found extremely frustrating! The person I was speaking to was clearly in training and showed no empathy what so ever. I wouldn't suggest OneMainFinancial for your financial needs.",

I began that call by asking if I would be better off going to a different branch and requested an honest answer as I feared from the first impression that this employee did not care to take the time to talk with me about my need and would possibly produce barriers to me successfully acquiring the loan. When I went back for the sit down I was thankful to be doing business with a different female. I believe her name was Melinda. She was very kind and knowledgeable. It was pleasant and painless. So maybe go a little further than first impression.",

It gave me options for secured loans and non secured loans, I applied for non secured loans, they ran my credit and last minute asked for additional information that’s needed for secure loans. I call and they say I only qualified for secure loans, if I want to add a co-signer I have to re start application and they would RUN MY CREDIT AGAIN!. Complete waste of time! I could have gone to a different place! Now I have to wait before I can have my credit ran again or I’ll hurt it even more! And my financial emergency just became so much harder. Thanks OneMain..",

I started working with Brittany who was very friendly and helped get our application started. On Wednesday she notified me that we were ready to close and on Thursday we started signing documents. Then the website seemingly glitched and wouldn’t allow my husband to sign his part. So they came back saying they needed identity verification, so we uploaded more documents, answered more questions, etc. All this time Brittany keeps saying “I’ll call you back in the morning”, “I’ll call you back in a little bit”, and hours would pass by with no call or update until I would call and ask. Finally after hours and hours over this week of trying to get this loan to finish closing, I call for an update and am told they decided not to move forward. Brittany didn’t even bother to call and tell me. This has been such a horrible, time consuming, anxiety inducing experience (and in the end all for nothing!) and I would absolutely not recommend using this company.",

She made me feel so comfortable with the over the phone process. She was so patient and very kind. I felt like I was talking to a real friend. I will always come to OneMain Financial for all my needs because of your quick turnaround and mostly because I was helped by Tammy. I will continue to use the Palatka office from now on. Thank You for hiring such a smart, kind and very helpful person like Tammy.",
