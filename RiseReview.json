Was told this past Thursday that the refund would be there on friday. Guess what it's Tuesday and was told again today 3 to 5 days but they are trying to expedite it.

  "reviewDescription": "I am not really sure what to say or where to begin. I get this flyer in the mail with hopes to apply for this loan and get some added help. So me and my roommate elect to apply for a loan we both get approved for up to 5,000. So we choose what we want and it shows the amount we pay and the interest and the payments. So except the terms and sign the loan agreement and think we are getting funds in the next 24 hours like it says. Nope no funds I get an email later that day that we both need to send in information to verfiy my ID, SS card and recent bank statement. We both send the required info I call back they got both of our information and good to go. They said need to sign back in and except the terms and the loan again and sign we do that then told get the funds in another 24 hours. Okay at this point I am like okay wow this as gone on for 2 days now back and forth. I have been told I was approved and get my funds and haven’t. I check my email today and we both got an email saying we were denied. I am like what denied for what we were told we were approved it says this reason for denial “unable to verify application information based on documents provided”. So at that point I’m frustrated and upset feel lied to and betrayed I call back and ask for a better clarification they can’t give me one they said it’s automatic generated response I am like give me a number don’t have one. Wow and no one there a supervisor no one can assist. They tell me all you can do is wait the 10 days and apply again wow I’m thinking and this is a company. They should be taking to court on this and sued. They even hit me with a hard inquiry and it says will run credit for a hard inquiry once signed and approved well I was WTH!!!!! I guess the next time should be cautious with who I try to do business with.",

  "reviewCompanyResponse": "Enrique, we regret to hear of your dissatisfaction. The loan is designed to provide you with funds at the best possible price and only if other forms of credit are not available or are more expensive. We review the cost of the loan in great detail in the loan agreement before the option to accept the loan is presented. We also offer a five full business day rescind guarantee in case you decide that the loan isn’t right for you. You can make extra payments and/or payments above the minimum amount at any time without any pre-payment penalties. And if you pay off your loan early, you will only pay interest and/or fees for the amount of time that your loan has been active. If there are additional questions or concerns, please email us rise_spokesperson@risecredit.com.\n\nYour RISEcredit.com Team\n"

Borrowed 5k in september of 2022 and paid loan off early, nov 2023 but still paid back almost 9k in interest, would have been 10k+ if i wouldnt have paid it off 7 months early. How can companies charge like loansharks in the movies. read that again, they made over 9k and was scheduled to make 10k on a 5k loan with payment terms less than 24 months. Again, like i said, atleast they got me the money when i needed it, but this helps explain why the rich get rich and the poor gets poorer. Thats over 100% interest every year on the original loan amount.",

Yes, it's an expensive form of credit, but they tell you that upfront, and they also tell you that you can save a lot of interest by paying extra when you can or paying your loan off early. I am extremely happy with this company and I will continue to obtain loans from there, because I trust them. Everything has been transparent and applying for a loan is always hassle free. I highly recommend them. Thanks Rise Credit.",

  "reviewDescription": "I NEVER thought getting a loan would be so EASY! I went to a typical financial institution to ask for a loan and there was so much red tape involved, you not only had to fill out a lot of paper work, you had to have collateral, and get insurance placed on yourself and the collateral and that added cost is also ADDED to your loan amount, which adds 1000's of dollars to your loan, on top of that you STILL have to pay interest on the entire amount! For example, you may get a check for $6999, the insurance on you and your collateral may cost another $10,000 bringing your loan to around 17k, add interest and you are paying back 35k, when you only received a check for $6999. Do the math you pay back 5 times what you actually took home! With Rise the loan was fast and easy! The money was in the bank the next day and the payment plan is simple to follow. The loan can even be paid off early, saving you money! Thanks Rise, the next time I need money fast, I will come here first!!",

  "reviewTitle": "Stay away!!!",
  "reviewDescription": "Stay away!!!! Interest rates are way too high. I have used Rise for years and this year was the straw that broke the camel's back. When applying for a loan, I always select the $2,250 loan with a payment schedule of 20 payments. This current loan I selected to do the same payment schedule. Fast forward a couple of months, I noticed my balance never went down only kept rising. Generally after a few payments, I would see a dollar or two come off of the balance, but this time I've only seen significant increases. I went to look at my contract and somehow my payback schedule was changed from 20 payments to 44 payments. I immediately called Rise Credit customer service to see if there was a glitch in the system because I would never select to make roughly the same payments I've made in a previous loan agreement for a longer term. So, now this new loan agreement is saying if I make all 44 payments will have paid back $8,430.79 for a $2250.00 loan. A total of $10680.78\n\nHere is the breakdown from the last three loans I have gotten through rise:\n\n1. (2023 44 weeks) $2250 270.85% $242.72 biweekly\n\n(8/30/2023 Edit: I received an email from Rise Credit corporate office stating that the rates and terms for a $2250 loan have changed from a maximum of 26 biweekly payments to a maximum of 44 biweekly payments. You no longer have the option to choose 20 or 26 payments. So, if you decide to go through with the loan for those 44 biweekly payments, you will have paid back $10,680.79 for a $2250 loan. The rates and terms on the \"What it costs\" tab are inaccurate.\n\n2. (2022 20 weeks) $2250 272.95% $262.20 biweekly\n\n3. (2021 20 weeks) $2250 277.97% $277.97 biweekly\n\nI am trying to figure out why in the world would I select to make more payments for roughly the same amount of money I was repaying in previous loans. I kept telling the representatives I spoke with that I would not select that. Also, if I selected to make 44 payments instead of 20 payments like I always do, wouldn't my payments be less?\n\nSomething is not right and I know it. I have been trying to get the corporate office on the phone, but no one will return my calls. I need answers.\n\nWhatever you do, find another way because this company is scamming people.\n\nPlease, please, please pay close attention to every click you make. Screenshot every step, especially the rates and payback schedule you select. Go back and check to make sure your clicks were correctly recorded. Also, making extra payments towards your loan does not go towards your principal balance. You will be making extra payments for nothing. Either pay off as fast as you can or make regularly scheduled payments.\n\nMost importantly FIND ANOTHER SOURCE TO GET MONEY FROM.",

The loan is designed to provide you with funds at the best possible price and only if other forms of credit are not available or are more expensive. We review the cost of the loan in great detail in the loan agreement before the option to accept the loan is presented. We also offer a five full business day rescind guarantee in case you decide that the loan isn’t right for you. You can make extra payments and/or payments above the minimum amount at any time without any pre-payment penalties. And if you pay off your loan early, you will only pay interest and/or fees for the amount of time that your loan has been active.

You can make extra payments and/or payments above the minimum amount at any time without any pre-payment penalties.

Yes, interest is high, but I knew that in the beginning. I recently paid off second loan. With help from Rise, my credit has improved greatly, all by simply paying on time. Please, before leaving a bad review about high interest, with bad credit it is unavoidable. If the need ever arises, I will use Rise again.",

We also offer a five full business day rescind guarantee in case you decide that the loan isn’t right for you. You can make extra payments and/or payments above the minimum amount at any time without any pre-payment penalties. And if you pay off your loan early, you will only pay interest and/or fees for the amount of time that your loan has been active.

If you are looking for fast approval, fast funding and efficient service, choose RISE credit.\n\nIt is true that the interest rate is less than desirable, however, one always has to assume this burden when seeking fast funds and a lower credit score.

We also offer a five full business day rescind guarantee in case you decide that the loan isn’t right for you. You can make extra payments and/or payments above the minimum amount at any time without any pre-payment penalties. And if you pay off your loan early, you will only pay interest and/or fees for the amount of time that your loan has been active.

This also occurs when you finally are able to get a customer service rep on the phone as well.\n\nThis continues to happen over the same request for months now, which is ridiculous. Who is managing & training @ Rise or even cares enough at Rise to actually follow thru with anything other than their own agenda?\nNot one person has corrected the request even now, which causes more frustration and headache than needed.\n\nAbsolutely ridiculous!

  "reviewDescription": "A zero rating would be more appropriate. Borrower BEWARE! I’ve been trying to pay this loan off for over a month now. My bank sent them a check on 4/22 and it was never received. I spoke to Rise customer service and was told checks are credited to accounts same day received. So, My bank sent another overnight to them on 5/17 with tracking and signature required. It was received 5/18 and signed for by an employee. Several calls since then and given multiple varying answers. Once it wasn’t received. Next it was noted as received on my account and would post by 5pm that day (it did not), then they would contact me within 24 hours and it would be “escalated” — no call. I called them with my bank on three-way, and was informed it had not been received and they couldn’t verify if the person who signed had it or not…and that it would take 7-10 days from receipt to post…tons of excuses and lies! When the original check was mailed it would’ve paid this loan off. Now I have accrued over $400 in interest atop the original amount thanks to their daily interest charges. Wish I’d NEVER hit the accept button on this “loan” and I HIGHLY advise you to avoid them at all cost! I’ve paid my loan every month, on-time, and never an issue until I want to pay it off to better myself and get out from under some debt. This company is nothing more than a payday loan service at best. Complete and total loan sharks with horrible customer service and extremely questionable business practices. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere. There are better alternatives. Take it from me!",

Excessive credit obligations\nAre you kidding me? My credit report hasn't got ONE SINGLE derogatory item on it. Excessive changes in personal information? The only thing that has changed on my personal info in 10 yrs has been my phone #. Excessive credit obligations? I made over $225k last year and own a $1.2 million dollar home. Who is running the credit qualifications at Rise Credit? It would have been nice to give you guys a little more business, but it's clear this is obviously a racial thing with Rise Credit.

The loan is designed to provide you with funds at the best possible price and only if other forms of credit are not available or are more expensive. We review the cost of the loan in great detail in the loan agreement before the option to accept the loan is presented. We also offer a five full business day rescind guarantee in case you decide that the loan isn’t right for you.

  "reviewDescription": "Full disclosure, I've been a Rise customer since 2016 and have taken and repaid 8 loans. For the most part, the experience has been great. The application process is easy, they work with you when you experience hardship, they take debit card payments which is oddly uncommon. I used to highly recommend them. Until today.\n\nI applied for a loan on Thursday 3/17. As a returning customer, the process was super easy. Just confirmed nothing had changed, hit submit, and was approved. I signed the loan agreement and they said the funds would be in my account the next day. The next day, the money isn't in my account. I log on and it shows my loan is in the funding status. Ok, maybe they sent it that day and it would be in my account the next business day. Sunday I received an email reminding me that my first payment would be due on Friday 3/25. Today, not only was the money not in my account, but I received a request for more information. I sent the information right away, and almost immediately received an email saying my loan was declined. I'm researching whether this is illegal, but is unquestionably immoral and shameful from a customer service standpoint. I will never borrow from Rise again and can no longer recommend that anyone else do either.",

  "reviewDescription": "At first I thought I found a decent company. The plan was to be able to repay the loan fast. However, my situation changed and my hope for a quick payoff disappeared. The payment from this company is far higher than any other similar loan companies I have used in the past. This is why I hoped to pay the loan off fast. Then when I hit a rough spot and fell behind in payments I attempted to work with RISE. They did offer a 3 payment plan to bring my account current. However, they locked my online account. So instead of allowing me the fastest possible way to make my payments, RISE made it incredibly difficult to make my payment plan payments. I tried to chat with customer service but they are useless. RISE even blocks their own customer service people from helping customers trying to make things right. All customer service does is give you a phone number to call. I found that to be a waste of time as well. Nor do I have time during the day to make phone calls and hang on the line forever! I was also told that after making 2 payments RISE would make 1 payment as part of the agreement to catch up my account. I was able to see my payment history, and to no surprise to me, one of my payments was missing in the payment history. What did RISE do with my payment? Did they hide my payment so they could claim I didn't make it and not make the single payment promised to me? All I can say is if you are thinking about using this company for a loan, I would recommend trying some other company. I have found RISE uncooperative and unresponsive when trying to contact them. Also very unhelpful when you want to work with them. I have filed several complaints with the company with no meaningful response what so ever!! I hope this makes it to the top of the review list because you should be very cautious about using this company!",

I was pre approved for one amount but I only requested a third of it. Now I figured out I needed more. But there is no way to get it now. Totally my fault and not Rise’s. Just wish I could fix it.",

  "reviewDescription": "Overall they did approve me for what I needed to put down on for my house when not one of my credit union wouldn't even give me a loan and I have money going to each account each month and had a decent credit score and pay all my bills and credit cards on time. Only thing I don't like is ill be over paying for the loan and they will be doubling off of me of what they gave me and my loan payment is quite high for a 22 payment. But they dud help me when I needed it. But fast and accurate respond and approval and fund delivery",

Once I finally logged-on it to change my AutoPay options it stated that I needed to call customer support to do that. No other financial institution does that! So I have to wait the following day to get ahold of a rep to change it. So, I'm taking their word for it. No confirmation. Then I asked if they could reimburse me for the $161.45 they took out of my account and 2 days later received an email DENIED. They are predatory lender!!

  "reviewDescription": "This has been a good company to do business with. Over the years, little emergencies have popped up and I have been able to count on this business for a loan at a reasonable rate. The process is easy, the deductions are within my budget. There are a couple of personal issues that I have that is the only reason for a 4 star rating - 1. the hard check on my credit for every new loan when I have paid on time with no adjustments to the schedule, no defaults. 2. I am always notified that my next loan will be at a lower interest rate - it never is - but you are owned by a new company so I understand you want to make money.",

I go to login in on their site ( I wrote down my credentials) and it would not work so I utilized the lost password feature . It did not send me a code nor a email link to reset . I tried both mobile and desk top . Used the auto chat feature and that was zero help . Emailed the helpdesk and they insisted i had forgotten my own bank login?? LOL If they would have read my email they would have comprehended that I was trying to access THEIR site . ZERO customer service , zero care . If they are this absent minded with a brand new app... do I really trust them with my personal financial info ?? No . And now I am reading BBB reports . I am staying away . Ridiculous",

But, after reading a few reviews and seeing how happy people were with their services I decided on giving them a try. The process went smoother than I expected. I did everything online. They reviewed everything within a day or so and before the weekend was over from when I applied on a Friday I had the funds in my account come Monday morning. I am very pleased with how fast the process went and how fast I got the funds. Granted, the APR% is very high, but I don't plan on paying the loan for that long, my goal is to try and pay it off earlier. Other than the APR%, I will most likely use them again if I ever needed to.",

The loan is designed to provide you with funds at the best possible price and only if other forms of credit are not available or are more expensive. We review the cost of the loan in great detail in the loan agreement before the option to accept the loan is presented. We also offer a five full business day rescind guarantee in case you decide that the loan isn’t right for you. You can make extra payments and/or payments above the minimum amount at any time without any pre-payment penalties. And if you pay off your loan early, you will only pay interest and/or fees for the amount of time that your loan has been active.

The loan is designed to provide you with funds at the best possible price and only if other forms of credit are not available or are more expensive. We review the cost of the loan in great detail in the loan agreement before the option to accept the loan is presented. We also offer a five full business day rescind guarantee in case you decide that the loan isn’t right for you. You can make extra payments and/or payments above the minimum amount at any time without any pre-payment penalties. And if you pay off your loan early, you will only pay interest and/or fees for the amount of time that your loan has been active.

The loan is designed to provide you with funds at the best possible price and only if other forms of credit are not available or are more expensive. We review the cost of the loan in great detail in the loan agreement before the option to accept the loan is presented. We also offer a five full business day rescind guarantee in case you decide that the loan isn’t right for you. You can make extra payments and/or payments above the minimum amount at any time without any pre-payment penalties. And if you pay off your loan early, you will only pay interest and/or fees for the amount of time that your loan has been active. If there are additional questions or concerns, please email us rise_spokesperson@risecredit.com.\nYour RISEcredit.com Team"

Not only did I not receive empathy or concern, but I was also told if the money is not returned I will be responsible for paying it back. I am still shocked the website does not have a pop where you enter an account number that warns applicants about the risk and consequences of a typo. Although I don't think it was a typo because I entered it twice and double-checked. At the time my caution/concern about making a mistake was fear of an email saying \"Your account number is invalid or your account does not belong to Michael Sullivan,",

In another day or two I will have a walk-in shower to facilitate my handicapped status. I appreciate RISEcredit giving me a chance to improve my quality of life. I pay ALL my bills on time everytime. What affected my credit rating was the plethora of hard inquiries accumulated while i was looking for a loan that i could afford (99% is high but it's commensurate with risk and i understand that. High risk, high reward.) However, it pales in comparison to 150% to 450%. Yes, bunky, there are 450% loans out there. You can look at the glass as being half empty and cry in your beer about the high interest rate or you can look at the glass as being half full and be thankful that there was a loan company willing to help out when you needed it most! I choose the latter.",

I’ve disputed with proof (a letter addressed to ME at the person who stole my ID’s address) and they refuse to remove the fraudulent info from my credit reports. That little $1000 loan is going to end up costing them 10x that amount when I’m done. Terrible shady company!\n\nUpdate: see Rise’s response to me below. As if they weren’t aware.

Additionally, they do not decrease interest rates for customers with excellent payment histories when taking out new loans as they advertise. Not recommended unless absolutely necessary, but they do grant loans where others don't.\n\nI updated after I spoke with Rise per their reply on my previous review, and they simply advised that the terms are as they are and nothing can or will be changed. This wasn't unexpected, but the person I spoke with was professional and understanding at least. During my call I was simply made aware that, even after multiple paid off loans, I could never expect to pay less than 99% interest(and I'm paying much more than this at the present time).",

After two days of waiting I called and found my checking account numbers were entered incorrectly. The numbers entered were not mine at all. I was then informed that I'd have to wait 3 more business days for them to find out where the funds were. Now in my email I'm asked to verify my info all over again. I'm now suspicious. I'm almost glad this all happened and that the loan didn't go through. I feel I narrowly escaped what would have turned out to be a harrowing ordeal.",

My last payment should have been withdrawn and I thought it would be over. Little did I know they didn’t take the money and started taking only 1.36 each check which was twice a month. I didn’t realize as I was sick and before I knew it they dinged my credit as being 30 days past due and that was after I went in and paid it off. I will never recommend or use this again. So they helped my rebuild and then dinged it unnecessarily. Very disappointed.",

I continued a ON TIME payment of $277.77 for the month of March. In April I received stimulus money and decided to take that and pay it off. I called a customer service representative who told me my balance on the loan was $2685.97. I paid it and the next day received an email that my account had been paid off! A few days later, they retracted and said I need to pay my payment for 277.77 for April. What in the entire HECK! I have paid off using all of my stimulus money, I have given a total of $3519.28 for a $3000 loan I took out 3months ago. Now they said I owe $368.00 more after paying them off and have completely ruined my credit over it! Please do not do business with these people! Please!!!",

They have deferred my payments several times. A lot of loan companies are not doing anything or very little. My loan twice a month payments with them are the highest of my things I’m catching up on. So it’s definitely a relief that they are helping out so much. That says a lot about a company ! I’ve never missed a payment so I haven’t had any other issues I see other people complaining about.

  "reviewTitle": "I’m so sick of Rise Credit",
  "reviewDescription": "I’m so sick of Rise Credit! I took out a loan back in dec of 2019 with an insane interest rate around 218%! I tried canceling initially right after I accepted since there’s a 5 day grace period, but they wouldn’t cancel. I called to find out what was going on and they claimed they never received the email to cancel and it was too late. At that point, hundreds in interest had already accrued. They eventually came back saying the found the email which was annoying.\n\nFast forward to this year, my hours were cut like a lot of people so I had to extended the payment date a few times which didn’t help me at all because the balance jumped up to an unmanageable amount.\n\nSince I wasn’t late on the loan, they wouldn’t work out a settlement with me and the balance kept going up and up. They finally decided to work out a settlement (still not a reasonable offer they gave) and I ended up agreeing just because I wanted it to be over with. I paid the settlement in full on the day agreed, and they took forever to update the account. The loan still kept accruing interest after the settlement payment was made and they wouldn’t update anything.\n\nThey finally updated it but a few days after they did, they reported me as 30-60 days late to the credit bureaus!!!!!!!!!! The reason I had such an issue getting them to offer a settlement was because I WASNT late or past due from what they kept telling me! So how do they report me as late after we agreed to settle on a specific date and the payment was made when we agreed!?!?!?!?! They told me multiple times I couldn’t pay before the settlement date after we generated the paperwork because any payment I made at that point would not go towards the settlement.\n\nThey are frauds and they just want to scam people out of their money. I’ve already grossly overpaid them if I add up all of the monthly payments I made along with the settlement, now they’re trying to report me as late and they increased the balance due to a crazy amount because they continued to accrue interest after we had agreed to a settlement amount AND after I made the payment!\n\nThey have no compassion on anyone during this time. The company is simply worried about money and that’s it. If I’m not working like I was before all of this started and I’m struggling to survive, how can you expect customers to be able to make payments with such high interest rates?? To not even lower the payment amount it interest rates during this time is disgusting! The money I wasted paying this billion dollar company interest could really help during these difficult times.\n\nI just don’t understand how the interest rates offered are even legal. They actually aren’t in CA anymore and Rise won’t don’t anything to help out.\n\nThis company is sick and please don’t wast your time with these types of places!!!!!\n\nI’m currently looking into starting a class action suit in CA!",

I made all my payments on time and in full and was in good standing so I thought they’d show some empathy. Maybe say \"Sure, let’s see how we can help!\" But they would not work with me on my payments for the final 3 months I had left. I'll never take out a loan with them again. The customer service rep was not friendly and just didn't care.\n\nI finally got around to making a payment. After I made the payment, they sold my account to collections. I'll never be a customer of theirs again.\n\nUpdate to their reply:\nYou showed no empathy to a loyal customer who always paid on time. Your reply is generic and unhelpful. It’s all about money and NOT your customers. I continue to be disappointed by customer service.",

Get thousands of dollars fast at very high APR (about 135%) and plan to pay early - no pre-payment fees, nice! Sounds okay, better than asking family for a loan for a few months, right? Okay in good economic times, but now the Federal Natural Disaster has been declared, and it's clear many RISE customers need a different payment plan. RISE will not alter anything, sending the same standard \"payment due as you agreed\" email over and over. What felt like a helpful loan now feels predatory.

I saw a lot of good feedback and for good reason.\nWas in a tough spot and needed money in advance. Took no time to get the money in my bank account.\nI was able to then pay it off a few weeks later and not pay too much in interest. Even if I had to use it longer term, the payments were very manageable.\nIt may be one of the clearest loans I've done. You have all your payments listed and shows the interest you are paying as it builds up so there is no surprises. They are easy to contact and don't just seem like some automated machine.\n10/10 would use again.",

  "reviewDescription": "I applied and received a loan with rise back in November of 2019. I made all of my payments on time and even paid itf off early to avoid the super high interest. Before paying the loan off, I spoke with a representative and asked if I paid out would I be able to reopen the loan. She advised that once I paid out I just had to wait 24 hours to apply again. I did exactly what she asked and was declined. I called back to ask why I was declined and the second rep I spoke with advised me that the application I filled out was for a \"refinance\" and the system did that in error. She advised to just wait until the next day and the system would allow me to apply for an actual loan again. Of course the next day the system did NOT allow me to apply again. I then called back and spoke with a 3rd rep who advised me that I was declined because of my \"credit score\" and i needed to wait 45 days to apply again. He also advised that I should of just refinanced the loan instead of paying it out, an option i was never offered in the beginning. Personally I would never deal with RISE again but if you do, be very careful and make sure you fully understand how your account works and what options are available to you.",

  "reviewDescription": "Please don’t take out a loan from Rise Credit! They are loans sharks and they lie. I signed for a $2,600 loan on 12/17/19 and the interest rate is $282%! I thought I had an emergency expense I needed to pay for, but luckily I ended up no longer needing the money. I emailed Rise on 22nd requesting to cancel the loan because it says on THEIR website that’s you have 5 business days to cancel.\n\nI didn’t receive a response so I called them on Monday late afternoon to verify they had canceled the loan and would rake the money back out of my account. I was told that somehow they never received my message even though I logged into my rise account and contacted them through their site. I received the confirmation message saying someone would respond, but they insist they didn’t receive it.\n\nI told the lady I was speaking with that I’m 10000% positive it said my message went through, and regardless I would still like to cancel because Monday would be the 5th business day so I was still within the 5 day period even if they wanted to lie and say my message wasn’t received.\n\nI was told that yes, it was the 5th business day, but that I missed the cut off tome to cancel!!!! No where on their website does it say there’s a time I have to call to cancel. I could understand if the place was closed, but clearly they weren’t seeing as how I was speaking to someone!! I’m so frustrated because now they are saying I owe $144 dollars in interest for a loan that I didn’t even use and tried to cancel within their grace period.\n\nHow in the world do I already owe $144 dollars in interest in 1 weeks time! That’s disgusting and they should be ashamed of themselves. They clearly lied saying they never received the message in order to keep me from canceling the loan just so they could rip me off and take my money.\n\nThey also are trying to get around the new California law that was passed and is supposed to be effective 1/1/20 that prevents loan companies from charging more than 36% in interest.\n\nThis company isn’t ethical and they will lie to rip you off. Please go anywhere else but here, it’s absolutely not worth it!!",

  "reviewDescription": "This for anyone new. The money is great to loan but be careful they do not have several things in contract that will make you take longer than expected to pay loan off. Example 2500k loan will cost you 9000k. How is this when borrowing they add interest already but charge daily interest as well depending on the state. My payment plan they will get there interest first and only after the first year.so if you pay 225 every two weeks they add 16.44 every day which equals 115 each week before you even make the first payment. As they responded to you review you will see how they advised me before hand and try to make it sound as if they did please note I'm not unhappy I decided to take the offer but they will respond like this. Dont sit there and respond to something I spoke the truth on. Also the customer service spoke with me and advised me that it was not in the contract but the additional interest is was the lender adds to you depending on the loan you applied for. Again nothing wrong with the loan but when you borrow be careful.",

I did not have a negative balance per my visit to my branch and my account was in good standing. So I don’t understand.\n\nI am very saddened to experience this up hill battle twice.

  "reviewDescription": "Thought it was too good to be true. Applying was way too easy. Finalized application and approved for $3k in about 10 minutes. Got what I needed and was saved from losing my apartment after getting hit with dental surgery that wasn't optional. Had enough left over to get my credit cards back below 30% AND pay off of a small loan I had. Maxed cards out paying bills beforehand and it wrecked my credit to below 600. Credit score will be over 700 soon. Never seen such flexible payments. I get paid bi-weekly, so my paydays are always odd dates. I was able to select that as a payment option. Payments come out the day I get my check, so I can't screw this up. Wow! So impressive! Wish I never dealt with another loan company. I wish my other large loan was with Rise. Will use Rise again and recommend to friends/family. So thankful for this company!!! Thanks, Rise!",

If you choose one of these loans, expect to be in debt to this company for a long time. They hit me with a 297% interest rate! I've paid on time for over a year and they will not offer a reduced rate! They use words like \"may\" and \"might\" in their polices so that they trick you into thinking they might go easy on you in the future, but just never happens... They collect a huge profit while you're stuck paying them for years! DO NOT GET A LOAN THROUGH RISE, YOU'LL REGRET IT!",

  "reviewTitle": "Approved... or not? Frustratingly Unhelpful Customer Service",
  "reviewDescription": "I had a great experience with my first RISE loan and was able to pay it back early, within 2 months of accepting the loan. The process was effortless. I received an invitation in the mail, entered my offer code and info and had the funds the next morning.\n\nUnfortunately, my experience in trying to get another loan has been beyond frustrating. I'm left with the feeling that RISE doesn't really want me as a customer or my 150% interest.\n\nThe first attempt resulted in my application being closed promptly after providing verification documents with no real explanation why.\n\nThe second attempt (started July 9th) resulted in a \"48-business-hour\" review process that turned into 9 days. I called RISE support earlier this week and the rep ignored my questions as to why the process was taking much longer than expected. (I felt like I was talking to a recording.)\n\nFinally yesterday I was advised to log in to the system and review the result of the Review. I was unable to actually access the page the email directed me to view; I was sent instead to complete another application. Confused, I called support yet again and was instructed that I was approved and just needed to fill out the forms again. So I did. Which then resulted in a duplicate loan in the system and re-opening the original loan from July 9th.\n\nThen, I get another email advising me to provide the same documentation (ID, SS card, proof of income) I had already provided before and wait another supposed 48 business hours.\n\nDon't bother emailing support, either. Email support is just as bad as phone support. What does that leave? Not doing business with RISE, I suppose.\n\nLesson learned: Approved does not actually mean approved, even if a support rep explicitly uses the phrase \"you're approved\".",

  "reviewDescription": "My initial experience with Rise was not bad at all. They were very prompt, streamlined the whole process, was able to get everything done in a reasonable amount of time. They claimed to reward returning customers, with offers like better tdd rates and terms. NOT ACCURATE AT ALL. Not only was I not given ANY better rate or term, RISE apparently now has an issue with my bank and after initially approving, waited until the end of the business day to revoke that approval. And, as far as I can tell, the statements about reporting to credit bureaus is false as well, nothing from them on either of the 3. But I bet if I'd defaulted on my loan or been late they'd make sure to report that. Don't buy the line about being different than other companies, they're not.",

I reached out to this company about a possible settlement a few weeks ago because of a financial hardship I was facing and was given zero options. I made a similar review on the better business bureau website and they asked me to reach out to them so they could look into this account. I emailed them my issue and the response I received was that they were looking into my account and if they needed more information they would get back to me. I never got s response so I emailed again looking for a follow up. Have never heard back. They are a fine company until you look for assistance. Please do not get caught into the same mess that I have and exhaust all options before you take this loan. I have 2 payments left and will struggle through to make those just to be done with these predatory lenders. And please do not believe the responses you see from the company reaching out to resolve bad reviews, they are just attempting to look responsive.",

The documents that I submitted originally were very legible, and were the same I've submitted in the past for other applications, and worked just fine. Then there was confusion after I had already been funded for the loan, I was called asking for more documents. Insane process, and would not recommend Rise to anyone.",

I'm not sure if you mandated to have that information on every single page on the application or if you do that for your own personal reasons, but it's annoying and it makes me feel like I shouldn't want to do business with you. But that is the only thing that I had an issue with. Everything else was great! Keep up the good work!",

  "reviewDescription": "I was grateful for the loan; however, the application asked for the date of my next paycheck. Based on that pay date, my payment due date for the loan was set for the 15th of the month for the duration of the loan. That is a problem for me since my paycheck arrives on the 3rd Wednesday of the month, which can fall anywhere from the 15th to the 20th of the month. I asked Customer Service if I could change the scheduled loan payment date. The answer was “No”, but that I had a “7-day” grace period in which I could change the payment due date each month 2 days before the scheduled due date. Not only is that arrangement inconvenient and risky, it comes at a price: additional accrued interest.\n\nYou can choose to get your loan money by direct deposit with automatic loan payment withdrawals from your bank account or you can get a loan check by snail mail and pay by check. With either option Rise is betting many borrowers will missed a scheduled payment date so they’ll earn extra interest or late fees.\n\nSo, please, please, please read all the fine print and ask Customer Support all your questions before you push that button accepting the loan.\n\nBy virtue of your needing a ridiculously high interest loan, the deck is stacked against you, and Rise knows that.",

If you are borrow a very small sum of money (under $1,000k) they maybe able to help you without you feeling cheated. But anything over, you will definitely pay the price. If your credit is not good, just skip over because you will be paying probably around 90% or more in interest. Know what you are getting yourself into.

  "reviewDescription": "Charge a crazy amount of interest on the loan. Like $1000 in 2 months!! Also website states good payments are rewarded with lower rates on subsequent loans, not true at all. Also if you are planning to request a new advance after paying off the first they say they don’t know how much your payments will be until they start taking it out?! Seriously. Their rates might be “lower” than a payday loan place or may offer more money than payday loans but they are just as greedy as the next. Preying on the desperate people who will never be able to make a reasonable dent in the balance loaned bc most of the payment goes to constantly accrued interest",

I didn't request for much, only $500 but to my suprise I got appoved for $800 and the best part about it is that it helps with my credit too. I have been working hard to try and fix my credit. Hopefully next year will be a little better with the help of Rise Credit. I recommended them to my friend and she got approved for $1000. She called my thanking me for referring her.

  "reviewDescription": "Loan was for $4000.00 financed in March 2018, I get paid weekly and they set my payment for bi weekly so they make more money on interest. I have paid $3465.19 to this day and still owe $3257.51 which will prob increase due to the interest rate. Shows it will not be paid off until the end of January 2020. I had the option to refinance and get possibly a lower interest rate and bam it was higher. I will NOT refinance nor recommend nor take out another loan when this miserable loan is done. I have also made additional payments and they just deduct that from my bi weekly payment so that doesn't help. This is not a good place for a loan!!! RUN FAR away and/or contact me a name of a company that is great!!!",

I didn’t know what to do. I recognized RISE from the mailings that were coming to my house, so when the opportunity came up to apply online I did. Within minutes I was approved for $3,500 and the money was in my account early after the holiday. This helped me catch up on the payments that I was behind on. This will be the first paycheck in almost a year that I won’t be overdrawn. I hope that I have learned my lesson. Thank you",

Yes, that is not a typo 10 times to find out what the status was. There was always something else holding up the process. I log onto my email this morning after another email I had sent asking what the status was and I was told I had to reapply. WHAT!!! are you kidding me. I did all the right things emailed the documentation to them and had to constantly follow up just to be asked for additional information. So please just a word of caution before applying. The people on the phone are nice but good is that if you cant get a result that you need. Not applying for a super high interest loan because you want to pay that rate.",

  "reviewTitle": "I got a mailer that I was pre-approved…",
  "reviewDescription": "I got a mailer that I was pre-approved for $3000. I didn’t believe it at first and didn’t apply since I get mail offers all the time! I hate doing online loans most time cuz most ask for so much paperwork and by then I quit cuz it’s not worth it!\nI honestly make good money, don’t pay a mortgage since I live with family that helps\nWith my kids. The reasons why I tried this was to see if truly this was going to work as it stated! I have had bad credit due to long ago medical bills! All the bad reports are medical bills! And also I have not checked my credit for last 5 years! Thanks to RISE i decided to check my reports and omg, there were so many mistakes on it! So out of curiousness I applied! All it did was ask me simple questions, basics! Then it asked how much I made, where I worked, and to fill in my checking account info\nThen it took me to a page that stated I was approved! Then had me go through several legal documents to check mark and also let me see exactly what I was approved for, how much each monthly payment would be, and the terms! I even had the choice to choose a smaller loan amount, and either faster payoff terms or longer! I loved that RISE gave me\nThe option to choose what amounts I wanted to really borrow! Either take the $3000 or less. It was all up to me!\nYes it’s high in payback, and something I normally would never take as a loan but I now know of RISE in case of any future emergency and I now know they are very transparent and give you plenty of chances to take the loan or not! That to me tells me they truly are here to\nHelp those that need help! And are really not\nAbout taking your money! They give you many opportunities to back out even a no risk 5 day cancellation after your funding too if you change your mind!\nYou can’t complain about the fees when your the one that is desperate for help that no other company will give you! If you don’t like the fees of paying back the loan no one said you had to ask for the help! But don’t ask for help then complain or give 1-2 stars cuz the rate! They gave me fair and plenty of information on how this is for emergencies and even tell you other ways to loan for less fees and interest!\nI didn’t need this in desperate measures but I took a loan and will surely pay back each month and I did it cuz it is rare to have a company trust those who have a horrible credit score when no one else will and in such very simple ways! It took me 10 minutes to apply! That is it and I did not have to turn in any documents at all and money will be in next business day!\nI don’t work for Rise or represent them I am just a Normal person, it was my choice to write this and I wanted to cuz it’s beyond me that people could sit here and complain or give less than 5 stars for taking a loan, getting help from RISE knowing full well the costs of the payback the percentage rate etc! They were more than overly transparent! If you thought the rate, or monthly payment was high then why do\nYou take the help no one else will give you then insult the people who helped you and by no means of hiding anything!\nI just went through the process, and I was told\nMore than needed that this was a loan for urgent needs thus higher and more expensive rates! They don’t hide that! And they let you know this throughout the entire process to make sure you know!\nSo to all those who take the help of someone that offers and gives you help that no one else will, and you take it. Then you complain! Wow\nGreat way of disrespecting the company that helped you when no one else probably and most likely didn’t! I know how it is when times are hard, we all do. No one has a perfect life, one day you can have a great job and make great money and it can be gone the next in a flash! So it is beyond important to be humble, and not to let money change you for the worst! Money is evil and it is the #1 thing that can turn brother against brother and wife against a husband! That is powerful! I once was at a great place, it took one car accident to turn my life 360! Going from independence to dependence! The fact that your so desperate to have to ask friends and family it can bring a persons soul in a dark and unhappy place! Some are lucky they have people they know who will and can afford to help, but know that when you do borrow and ask for help, there is always going to be a thought in your mind that you owe that person more than the money you borrowed! It’s better to ask for help with programs like RISE! There is no personal attachment or that “I owe you forever and will do anything for you for what you did” feeling! Cuz if that person you did get help from ever has something they can’t do themselves, best believe that you will be that person they will turn to! Take only what you need! And borrow here the exact amount that will help you, and use it to get out of whatever bad spot your in! RISE approved exactly what they said they would, and in 10 min I was approved and confirmed for next business day deposit! I am\nGlad that I chose to try it out cuz now I know one company that will truly help when I need it and faster than any bank!\nRise your a saint! Thanks for all the help and for giving so many people the chance to rebuild their credit and to get out of emergency situations!! I don’t know how it is that you will trust all of use that have shown not so great credit, but I believe it is cuz you too may have once been in a spot where you had no help! Perhaps the owner knows how it is to be so desperate for help and not get it! RISE I give you blessings for the countless people you have saved , when in their darkest moments of desperation! Your a saint and your name says it all! RISE from your sadness and hopelessness and then keep rising to a better place!",

Their little comment, \"no penalty for paying off early...\" of course they don't care when you pay it off because they take ALL of their money immediately! Way to take advantage of desperate people!\n\nNO THANK YOU!\n\n\nReply: I know how it was set up. The CSR told me if I didn't cancel within the 5 days my balance went from $2000 to $3200.

I asked for information on a loan . Rise credit popped up along with 2 other companies. I chose rise because there loan reviews were awesome. From start to finish maybe 20 minutes. After I hit proceed I was approved less the 3 minutes. Email said you're money will be deposited Monday morning. 8am I got a alert on my account. 1000.00 IN MY ACCOUNT JUST LIKE THEY SAID. They made it super easy to help you. I never had a experience like this from a bank. They set me up for a payment that works for me. Rise sets you up from a to z.\nExtremely happy with Rise.\nJim\nDallas Texas",

I have been a very loyal customer, and I've paid back every loan on time, actually before time. And this is how they treat their customers. Now i don't have money to feed my child because they took all that I had. My account will also now be overdrawn with fees because bills coming from my account will bounce. I HATE RISE. NEVER AGAIN",

My first four went all towards interest nothing towards the loan. I got a $900.00 dollar loan and still paying it back I gave them $2400.00 and not yet done with the loan. Loan place not worth it.",

During his call to my bank he was courteous, patient and very professional. On 10/16 I had to call again to confirm the bank info and Jade was OUTSTANDING, professional and patient. She was extremely kind, especially when dealing with my bank customer service who seemed rushed, rude and not a very good listener. Jade never moved from her calm professional demeanor. These two agents should be exemplified in the tactics for good customer service.",

I have a legitimate checking account that belongs to me, is in good standing and I have received weekly direct deposit for the past 8 months. I sent in 2 bank statements and proof of account ownership but was denied credit because Rise failed to verify my account. I question the validity of this company. If they really wanted to acquire and retain customers I would expect a little effort on their part to correct their mistakes.",

All of a sudden I had to make payment arrangements with them and they could no longer extend the payments. I had lost all of my income and couldn’t pay any longer. I called them and they told me that I had signed the paperwork and there was nothing they could do about changing the rules. Yes they can, it’s their company. Instead they just wanted all the fees and interest to keep accruing because anything that goes over the $2500 value they can charge what they want to. Everything under that to a $2500 cap off they would have have to keep its payments and fees minimal. It’s the law. I had borrowed $3000 and paid well over $1600 back. I went to a consolidation company and then RISE waited 59-68 days to add it to my credit report. That’s a shame!!! Good luck getting your money of which I don’t have and thanks for being jerks about it. I’ll never do it again!!",

I thought I was ok because I had a good credit score, but apparently that didn't matter. Then I found RISE. I applied, and within hours I had a positive answer. There was no hassel, no waiting or hesitation. Also, I am totally blind and because the web page is so accessible, my screen reader was able to take me through all the necessary steps to complete the process. It was a great experience for me and I would recommend this company to anyone. Thanks RISE for all my assistance.",

  "reviewDescription": "I have been a customer for over a year making payments on time never missed a payment. I have requested to refinance and they will not allow me to do so. I am paying close to $400 a month for my payment for over a year and loan no where near paid off. I feel this is very unfair and unreasonable. I am sad to say I will NEVER use their services again, and I will not refer anybody to RISE Credit!! I am a very unhappy displeased customer! They are telling me that I have to wait for the automated computer to email me in order to refinance, and that there is not an actual person that you can talk to about a refinance this makes no sense at all.. I would not recommend RISE to anybody. I wish I would of explored my options before jumping into something such as this.. This is a total rip off. People please read the fine print and be aware of what you are signing up for. I will be paying over 10,000 for a $4,000 loa",

Well, you have to begin paying them back on your following pay, so if you get paid weekly then you'll be expected to pay the week following your loan. The date is calculated by what you enter. And to avoid an overdraft, you have to make sure the funds are in your account. They do have a grace period, so just communicate with them.\nJust take time and read before you sign.",

My only issue and the reason I gave the lower rating is because the interest rate is OUTRAGEOUS!

My one big complaint with Rise online account is this \" You can also check your balance or extend a payment 24/7 through our automated phone system.\" I tried this but am told by the recorded message that the office is closed right now and when to call back. If it says I can extend a payment 24/7 through your automated phone system you need a way to do that. Also it seems that when your office is closed your online account management system will not load so we can not access our account online after business hours. It is not my computer because I tried on multiple computers. Really need this remedied Rise.",

  "reviewDescription": "I just obtained POA for my elderly mother's finances. When I went into her checking account, I saw that she recently received a $1,500 deposit from Rise. She was too proud to tell me she was struggling, got a preapproved offer from Rise and went for it thinking they'd approve her for $500 or something. At 77 years old, she lives on only her meager $600 social security checks each month. Yet somehow...Rise approved her for a $1,500 loan this month. Um. She gets $600 a month?! And the interest rate is downright obscene. So now, they'll take more than half of her monthly income for the next year until the loan plus interest is paid.\n\nThe fact that Rise approved her on $600 a month income derived solely from Social Security is the epitome of predatory lending. Not to mention, she lives in Arizona where Rise supposedly does not even do business. Not sure how that happened - her income statement, drivers license, etc. all show AZ as her place of residence. I've just contacted the Attorney General in Arizona, and am going to make sure I cause as much ruckus as I can about this company and their illegal tactics to prey on seniors.",

  "reviewDescription": "Was not a quick and easy process especially if you have multiple sources of income. When filling in the application, my primary source of income was entered with direct deposit payment dates. Self-employment income was added as a secondary source of income. My application was processed then funded and subsequently rescinded and put on hold because someone at RISE changed my self-employment income to a primary source of income and requested tax documentation as proof even though bank statements had already been submitted. It was several days of back and forth over documentation and they were not quick about notifying you when they were not satisfied with documents submitted. All three times notifications were sent, it was after the cut-off date for receiving information which pushed completion of my application several more days after the request. It took a full week for the application to funded. Very frustrating!!",

And since they replied to comment, let me state that it tells you the projected payment amount on your FIRST advance, if you take more at a later date, you will know how much you are paying the next business cycle. JUST AN FYI TO ALL NEW CUSTOMERS bc what they said in the reply to this is only true to the first advance, trust me because I would have suffered than to get a \"Surprise! Your payment is..\"",

  "reviewDescription": "Current customer, and upon being in a bind, had to re-finance with the outrageous 59.9% interest rate, hell car dealers don't rape you that much ! However, upon doing so through their website, the requirements are to use Google Chrome, which I already have, Yet, chrome wasn't what it needed at all. Within chrome, none of the drop down boxes would work and no information could be put in, and at the bottom of the page it would display \" processing\" ! You can't process if no information is input into the system. This was on a Saturday, called and the employee , friendly, walked through it all and again stated that chrome was the browser to be used. All setting on my end were checked and double checked to ensure nothing was being blocked and was being performed correctly. Therefore, the loan could not be processed and an \"issue ticket\" was ordered and submitted to their IT dept to find out what the problem was. The problem was their end, without any doubt ( I work in IT )\nWith it being on the weekend , it would be Monday before it would be addressed and fixed and was told an email would be sent to confirm. By Tuesday, no email, no call and I called to inquire, was told by a rude girl that a ticket was put in and would be fixed, I asked for it to be escalated and was rudely told that any ticket submitted was escalated . ( which only means, first come, first served ) No one could seem to explain why this was happening, perhaps speaking to the IT person would have been a better solution, but that was not an option, this company prefers to communicate via email ONLY, not a good practice as some may not have access to Internet at all times. But was told it would be fixed and notified by next day ( Wed) It's currently Thursday and still no money ! However, something told me to try Internet Explorer and BOOM it worked ! Was able to complete the application and it was being processed ! Great . right ? NOPE ! Received an email that the problem was fixed and the account was reset and I had to go back and re-apply ! Nooo, it had already been done through Internet Explorer and and was processing and re-applying was NOT an option ! So, fotthe amount of money you are raping people for, how about possibly paying for some REAL Internet Technicians that know what they are doing ! Nothing worse than the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing ! COMMINICATE with each other internally and with the customer, test your systems on all browsers and educate yourselves, clearly you don't have a good system and your emplyess needs better training !",

  "reviewDescription": "I'm quite positive this won't be shared, no one likes negative reviews otherwise, who'd borrow? I truly wish I had read the reviews before I signed up. I was approved for a $2500 loan, which I needed desperately. At 237% interest, it took FOREVER to pay it off. Once I did, I was told I could get another loan with lower interest. Fantastic, right? I've been trying for two months to get another loan. Rep after Rep told me to wait ten days and try again. This time, another REP told me to wait 45 days. I'm quite positive it's because they didn't make any money off of me as I paid it off early. Don't waste your time with these people!",
  "reviewRatingScore": 2,
  "reviewCompanyResponse": "Thank you for reaching out to us in regards to your concerns. When an application is submitted and declined, we do advise to wait a full 45 days prior to submitting a new application. This time is to allow any misinformation to be updated between applications. RISE encourages you to get out of debt as soon as possible, however if you need additional credit you will see a 50% drop in your rate on future loans after making 24 months of scheduled payments (excluding customers with starting rates of less than 75%). Even better, after 12 additional months of payments, you will qualify for a 36% rate!** When a new application is submitted, we are never able to guarantee an approval. If you would like additional information on application results, please contact us at 866-580-1226 or via email at rise_spokesperson@risecredit.com.\nThank You,\nRISE Credit"

Then when I really needed to re-finance my loan they said I couldn’t lol 😂 because I had been late on a payment?! Funny thing is they always got their money I just had to call to change the date stressed out until they finally just gave me a regular date on the day I wanted originally. Sad 😞 thing is I had to miss my nephews wedding but that’s the life of a disabled person! I did appreciate that they were there! So I didn’t give them a 1 but I was pretty upset when the following month after I was told that I couldn’t refinance my loan that they wanted to refinance. I ended up missing a pretty special wedding 🎩 sad smh 🤦‍♂️!!! Aggravated enough that I won’t be back, & I won’t recommend Rise to anyone... But thanks for the loan I needed the $ n u were there.",
