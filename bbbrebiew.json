I received a confirmation that it was rescinded. Today, 01/12/2024 they took ***** from my account, but they never deposited the funds so basically they stole the money from me. I called them and they said it had been deposited. We had a 3 way call with my bank and my bank confirmed the money was never deposited so of course my account was negative and I was closing on an apt today in the afternoon. Instead of reversing the withdrawal, they said they would escalate the issue and it would take 3 to 4 business days so I'm negative until next week so no food no nothing. My bank said that it is FRAUD and but since the transaction is still pending we have to wait. Once it is no longer pending, they will file a fraud report. "

I am due a refund for a payment they took from my checking account before the due date.  I now have a credit balance of over $300.  I was informed they hold refunds for 10 days (all there days are working days) before they send a check. They are making money on my money for 20+ dayys on money I sent them!  This company treats their customers new and returning like dirt.Avoid this company  if it is all possible.  I was stupid until I noticed the monthly payment you send them is only interest on the money they loaned you, no money goes to the payoff the money you borrowed!Even if you are having problems paying your bills borrowing from this company only delays bigger problems in the future!  I have learned that if you talk to your creditors they will work with you. A lot of people are having trouble paying their bills courtesy of inflation andour federal government!"

  "body": "Back in 2020, I lost my job due to the pandemic and hit a dire situation. I was short on rent and car note, and needed the loan to avoid eviction and repossession. I didnt have any other resources to help. So, I resorted to using Rise to get a personal loan. I was desperate and wasnt thinking and just accepted what I could get. I got the loan in about 3 days and was able to keep my car which I was using to pay my bills and keep my family from being evicted, but soon realized I was being put into an even worse situation. After months of paying the monthly payments (not noticing that the principal balance was barely going down), I hit another bad situation. And in June of 2021 I received an email stating that I was eligible to refinance my loan and receive another loan. Stupidly, I accepted, thinking that my monthly payments was paying down the principal. After paying $360 each month for half a year, I decided to re-evaluate my financial responsibilities because things were not getting any better. I checked on the progress of my loan the balance only went down by less than $200! I had paid my bill on time for half a year, but only $156 went towards the balance?! Thats outrageous. I called Rise customer ********************** to inquire about the issue and I was told that nothing could be done because I had agreed to the terms of the contract and accepted the high interest rate. I couldnt afford to keep paying that much per month, and not paying down the balance by a decent amount. Not even my student loans are that bad. Now, I have a looming collection in my credit report.

The financial institution (bank) I used sent them a check via **** for the amount RISE said was a pay-off. This was sent around April 22nd. Three weeks later...nothing. They have NO record of receiving the check for the pay-off amount. Meanwhile, their daily interest amounts were causing the balance to RISE! (I see how they got their name)... They requested tons of info, which I provided to my best abilities and no resolve. So, after calls back-and-forth and some research from the bank I used for my new loan -- they found the check had been returned / denied receipt.  It was the CORRECT address -- a P.O. Box in ******, **. Sent on 4/22 and returned weeks later. So, after some back-and-forth again, I was told an overnight check would be credited to my account same day as received and my bank sent them a check OVERNIGHT via ***** on 5/17...with tracking...to their \"Overnight Payment\" lock box/physical address in **********, **..it was received and signed-for on 5/18 at 9:38am. 5pm rolls around and no credit to my account. Same on 5/19. On 5/20 I contacted RISE and was told a note on my account said the check was received and should post on that day by 5pm. As of 7pm, I now have a balance $433 higher than pay-off and no credit to account. A call to them again -- no record of receiving any checks, just notes on my account about my calling them previously and \"why can't you just pay it off and let the bank reimburse you?\" comments made (because banks don't work that way when THEY want to pay-off a loan). They've escalated my \"ticket\" and allegedly will call me within 24 hours. Meanwhile, I'll have to wait until Monday to contact my bank again to see if the check was cashed, and go through goodness knows what to resolve. I cannot say it enough... I DO NOT RECOMMEND RISE CREDIT FOR ANYTHING! It's predatory lending at best and they're not very professionally operated. "

  "body": "  I decided to get a loan from this company when my hours were cut at my job during the pandemic. Everything went smoothly with Rise Credit until I refinanced my loan after getting it halfway paid off. The pandemic was still going strong and I was settling into a new job. Interest rates are way too high. The balance literally doesnt go down by the time they add 9 dollars a day till your next payment! Highway robbery at its finest, I must say.  A few days ago, I decided to pay the loan off in full. They locked my account from making online payments due to a supposed fraud alert saying the bank declined the payment. After a call with my bank and them checking everything on their end, they said the company didnt even try to process a payment!   The second lie they told me my account would be unlocked after 24 hours so that I could again pay online. My account was never unlocked so that I could pay it, of course. Let me add, Ive never had an issue paying the loan monthly ever. All this chaos didnt begin until I tried to pay the loan off fully on 10/14/21. The third lie I was told on the phone by one of the representatives that I could just overnight a check and that as soon as they got it, they would apply that to the loan the same day and get it taken care of. We put a tracker on the check and also required a signature before release in case anymore lies came up. The check arrived at the front desk in the morning around 11:37 a.m and an employee signed for it. I waited hours before getting in a live chat to get an update. They told me they never received the check. Wow really? I shouldve known. I told them about the **** update and they said their team works on the checks and my check would be posted on 10/16/21. Mind you again; everyday they add 9 or more dollars to your balance.   It is now 10/16/21. It is early in the morning but I decided to just log into my account to see what interest has been added to my balance. Surprise, surprise! I have ZERO account access! I cant even log in and I have no emails of why I cant. Honestly, it feels like I am being held hostage just for trying to pay them nearly 3k to close out the loan and wipe my hands clean of this company! I feel like a football player, the ball is the money, I am trying to get it into the touch down zone and the employees of Rise Credit are acting as the other teams defense keeping it out. This is one football team you dont want to play with. Find another solution! Either they call this game correctly on Monday or my attorney will be the referee. "

I thought this would be good for a small business start up revenue. The service and level of repeated requests for the same document is ridiculous. I was asked to send these documents over and over again in various forms and when I obliged, it was always something wrong. I sent these forms in pdf, after being told the 7th time, and then they were still unable to be opened. I spent more than 24 hours back and forth with this company about documents received.  I even sent my social security card  and id card sent in 5 images to ensure the edges were showing and that the signature and number was visible. I feel there is some fraudulent activity and makes me feel uncomfortable, especially with agents working from home and their pets and phone issues interrupt the call. Inconsistency:Agents were saying \" this has to go through our verification department\" while other agents ( supervisor and non supervisors) said \" well, I can see right here what is missing and needs to be corrected\". What in the world is going on here?Income verification:This was an atrocious experience. Several of the agents advised me to explain that my second income is 10 months and my primary income is received on the last day of the month. I was repeatedly told that my primary income paystub was outdated I assume because of 6/30/21 being the pay date. Again, being paid on the last day of the month means my next check will not generate until the last day of July. Sadly, I sent a document verifying my next pay, as well and this was still not sufficient. Finally, after about 7-8 representatives, one thoroughly explained that they just needed what the confusion was with the dates and we were able to rectify the issue. All other agents just read the script.FOLLOW UP:After waiting to hear from them a few days, I called and they explained that I have to wait on a phone call to the number thats on my consumer report just to verify I am the real person. The representative, supervisor and On Duty Manager ( *****) all repeated the same information- that this was the LEGAL PROCESS. Each asked me if In wanted a call back..... why would you call me back to tell me ti wait for a callback to verify my number? They were unable to tell me what number , time or date to expect the phone call.  I explained that, just like them I am at work and with all the **** calling my phone may not accept the random or unlisted number. I asked \" what happens if I miss both the phone calls?\" ...... each of them went on to explain that I would need to wait for my application to go inactive and then REAPPLY!!!!Listen, this has been the worst experience of my adult life in terms of borrowing money. I wish I would have read these reviews before provided them with all my information."

I was sent an email by their company in January asking why I had not activated. I replied and advised **** was never received. After no reply I called and was told card was sent on January 6, 2024 to the wrong city and a replacement was issued in February. I advised on February 15, 2024 card was still not received after at least 4 telephone conversations advising I had received a bill for $39 for my annual fee due March 1, 2024 for a card a still never received. I have email communication where they replied to my concerns as I was told by ALL the staff, there was nothing they could do. I had to pay the bill whether the card had been received or not since it was annual. So my question was since the card has yet to be received, shouldn't the annual fee be due once the card was received and activated? Initially the last person spoken to stated your annual fee will not be due until you activate. I asked for that in writing and after a ten minute hold, she came back and said sorry the fee will be due in January. So my question was if I don't receive the card until April, the annual fee instead of 12 months becomes 9 months THIS COMPANY HAS ALL EMPLOYEES WHO BARELY SPEAK AND UNDERSTAND ENGLISH AND WHEN I ASKED FOR A SUPERVISOR, AFTER AN EXTENDED HOLD, WAS TOLD THERE WERE NONE BUT THE ANSWER WAS I STILL HAD TO PAY THE *** ON A CARD NOT IN MY POSSESSION.

They said I would have to call back but was informed again no due date change was available. I ask if they could have a manager contact me.

Took awhile, but each morning I check Informed Delivery to see what to expect in the mail, and the card was there.  However, when I retrieved my mail later in the day there was no card.  I immediately called Avant and explained what happened.  Was told to wait a few days even though it had been scheduled for delivery that day.  Then I received an email thanking me for activating my card and I called again only to find out someone had gotten the card and used it to buy sneakers at a Foot Locker far from my home.  Now, I am a 76 year old woman with mobility issues,  Definitely would not be buying sneakers. I notified Avant and was forwarded to their fraud department.  I explained what happened and they said they would investigate.   My account was blocked meanwhile, and they actually told me to make a payment on it.  No way was I going to pay for someone else's sneakers.  Okay, fast forward to about a month later.  I received a new card in the mail, my account was unlocked, and I was free to use it.  I made purchases and payments.  Everything was settled or so I thought. Several months later I received an email from the fraud department.  My account was again locked because per them \"I said I never applied for the account\" and was a victim of identity theft.  They NEVER responded to any of the emails I sent.  My account was blocked again. By now I just wanted to pay it off and close it.  The same nonsense has started again now in December.  Neither the fraud department nor compliance ever responds to me.  I want it taken off my credit report,  I am at my **** end.  Can't get anyone to respond.  Please help.&nbsp;&nbsp;"

I call them and ask what the status is and wanted to make sure I submitted everything correctly. They stated that I do not need to do anything on my end and wait for a email/phone response -- they also did a hard credit pull. It is ridiculous that this company does not let the end-user know the status of your application and keep you in limbo for days on end.

  "body": "This stupid credit card (AVANT) needs to be shut DOWN completely.  In 2022 I had an account with them, paid the account off, then small charges started appearing after the account was CLOSED.  I called for an investigation with their fraud department and while they were investigating the charges they sent me another credit card with a different number which I did not ask for, CRAZY!  I cut up the credit card and sent another letter to closed this freaking account.  They also put a delinquent **** on my credit report for those charges which I did not incur.  Now, here I an in September 2023 and I just received a bill from them for an account that has been closed since 2022.  What the heck does it take to get through this stupid creditor???  I'm send a complaint to all three credit bureau's, I'm so DONE with them.  They are the worse credit card to have!"

  "body": "Early this year I was placed out of work from an injury and ended up having surgery. I attempted to contact the company several times to see if they had any programs to help me reduce the late fees or assist with me getting back on track. I even requested to speak with a manager and the representative stated at first no manager or supervisor was available. After several minutes on the phone and inquiring why I couldn't that's when he said one could give me a call back later because the representative was working from home. I never heard from a manager. In most emergency situations a company would normally work with customers trying to resolve their accounts. I used part of my last $50 trying to lower my bill which was over by $200. 2 days later Avant added on another $39 late fee with almost $15 interest which was useless. Their's nothing worst than to be out of work and recovering from major surgery while trying to tackle your debt. If you're looking for customer service, ********************** LLC definitely lacks it. I wouldn't recommend this company to no one. You never can predict what will happen with your health. "

Returned a couple of expensive items a couple of months after purchase totaling $1100. Overnight my credit limit dropped to $300!! They DID NOT send me an email or anything telling me this. I went to use the card and it was denied by the retailer. Looked at the app to see the limit dropped to $300. Called and they gave no excuse, said I'd receive a letter. When the letter FINALLY arrived it said the reason for the decrease was \"Credit Card Activity\". Apparently, you can't get any refunds without them getting back at you. Since then I quit using the card and paid them off. I will never use that card again! They're not getting $1 interest from me ever again! Avant = Horrible Credit Card! Don't get one."

Over a dozen phonecalls with their awfull robot like agents.

I already emailed you and let you know I just started my job, so had just one paystub. I have phone recordings and emails to proof this, my credit is down almost 15 points from this pointless enquiry. They gather all sorts of information from you, just to waste your time and mislead consumers, it's quite evident from all reviews here, they just never learn and this has to stop immediately.

Their customer service is outsourced to ***** and they are VERY LIMITED and scripted in how much they can help. Emailed resolutions. They emailed me back and told me to call customer service. Requested a supervisor numerous times only to be told they couldnt find one and would call me back. They never did.

The reps are not knowledgeable, not helpful, and seem very confused. The reps cannot answer basic information about your account, and only repeat themselves, sounding like a darn robot. It is very frustrating and annoying to try and get some resolution and account details, and I want to say they are just adding fees because the balances and amount due don't even make sense. It is a shame supposedly this is headquarter in *******, and I am speaking to people in a third world country when I am literally down the street haha. I have asked for a late fee waiver and they refuse to give me one. Not sure why. That is disturbing and they reply with this generic reply not justifying why a customer can't have one late fee removed if it is their first. I am going to work hard to pay this card off and close it, the headache is not worth it. It would be different if someone could truly help you and explain the information, but since they cannot, I figured I would try to seek help elsewhere. THEY ARE TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!"

I don't know any company in this day and age that doesn't help their consumer pay their bill with the option to change their due date.* They do not show a true accounting ledger type ongoing balance before a transaction or payment and so on and so on so you cannot prove what you need to check out is accurate and correct.* Their security fraud feature is an excellent feature. But...When it thinks there's possible fraud the only alert you get is a phone call to answer the computer so it will leave your account open to use. That leaves too much error of not catching the computer at the right moment to answer its questions and if you use the card it then locks the account for fraud and it could take a week or so to reopen your card. It also leaves you to constantly constantly have to call the credit card representative which do not know what they're doing. And have them check and answer to see if any of those charges were fraud.I received a large amount of money and remodeled my apartment and bought all new furniture. The card was utilized and the security feature kept hitting I didn't realize the call came through so I missed my chance I used it again it declined my transaction so I had to call and have been doing this for 2 weeks.My card is now frozen cannot be used in any way shape or form they've had to escalate it and there is no time frame as to when they'll get to it or how long it will take.since I made so many transactions and so many calls to find out why it declines each time I call they need to confirm the transactions. Very good security protocol. But...If I called yesterday answered if those specific transactions were valid and were made but declined then why the next day when it does it again do I have to go back to the very beginning and start over every  time."

I am so tired of calling, I have a balance on the card I do not want to pay off a card that I want to use and still have a high credit  limit on and still never receiving card. I even checked my old address mailbox with permission NOTHING I do not know what to dO at this point its nerve wrecking "

The letter stated that the credit bureau they used was transunion.  My first step was to call the company to find out what this letter was about.  The rep was very questioning.  He wanted the Last 4 of my social, my address and dob . When he continued to ask for my email I refused.  He kept talking about transferring me to the fraud department.  I told him to transfer me and I'm not giving him anymore information.  He refused to transfer me and told me that without the email he was going to end the call. Next call I made was to Transunion who informed me that there was never any report inquiry from Avant . This letter was all a Rouge.  I have no idea what they were trying to accomplish but they were certainly unprofessional when I called.  Supposedly they have all my information so why keep asking me questions.  I would run from this company.  I also had to freeze all my credit bureaus accounts for safety and security.  "

Paid off entire balance that the rep told me. Never did she mention that there would be more charges after that day. I received letter saying it wa closed. Then 2 month later I get a bill for like $ 35 that included late fees.  I tried calling and numerous times the representative said their lines where down. Finally got through and asked what is was all about and they said \"trailing charges\". Noon eever told me to go back and see if I had such! I then asked that I pay only the \"trailing charges\" and they should remove the late fees that I didn't need to pay die to thermos lack of communication.  Nope. Woudnt do it. I am forced to pay this amount now to keep them from going into my credit report. The issue isn't the $35 the issue is their lack of communication when closing these accounts is deceptive and when they pull the recording they will hear that the representative NEVER told me that. This is a class action lawsuit in thr making. I went from a couple dollars that I still don't know how i owed if I paid off the account in full to paying $35. No. These people need to learn to be honest. This matter is going to court. And they will lose. Its black and white. "

They are bogus, and true scammers.  But let me tell you why, and by the way I wrote a review on March 7, 2023 and for some reasons cannot find it.  Needless to say, I went online and thought I was approved by a legitimate company.  When I was asked to do certain things, my mind was saying loud and clear that this is a scam.  A woman named *********************** called me and said I was approved for a 2K loan to be paid monthly of ***** for 12 months.  She asked me for my banking information, and said it was for a verification process.  Stupid me, knowing you never give your info out to anyone, but I did.  She told me her account manager would be calling me back with specific instructions.  A man named ***************** who could not spell his last name called me.  ****** was put into my checking account, and I was surprised.  **** called me and asked me to get a wal-mart silver money card for ******, but do not tell wal-mart it is for avant. I did it anyway, and called him back with the infor on the card then he asked me to send a pix of the receipt and card.  I did, and he said it was for verification.  He said the 2k would be in my account in 3 hours.  No show!!  He called me on Monday morning and asked if I checked my account, and I did,  He had already taken out the balance of the 490, and made my account negative ******.  He said my account will be negative ****** and when I send the ****** back to him, I will get the 2k.  I realized it was a scam!!!  My bank called me on Monday also, and told me my account was negative ******, and I was scammed by avant.  I closed my acct. He called me back and demanded that I finished the transaction. They have a website phone # and address, but they are the best scammers. RUN.. I hate scammers, these ppl are really good at scamming!!! RUN!!"

This went on for 6 days, each day I would call and speak to different representatives, informing them all that I had completed those task. They would confirm with me that was accurate and told me we will process your application and approval could can taken place within the same 24hrs. This was my same scenario every day for 6 days. On day 7, I received an email stating that my application had expired and I would have to re-apply. In disbelief I contacted Avant and the representative pretty much read my email to me, before I could even speak to tell her why I was calling. I informed her I would like to know why they dropped they ball? Why did they send the same emails to me daily with task I had already completed. When I asked for a supervisor, I was told they were on the phone with someone else and the representative would schedule a call back for the supervisor to call me That call back never happened. Please dont waste your time with this company, please dont give them your personal information and then receive a soft or hard pull on your credit. They acted as amateurs or a scamming company."

After someone finally kept me on the line, listened to my problems and then took my payment, she told me Id be contacted via email to fix my login issue. This was January 2. I just received an email yesterday regarding this. If I emailed this company about my issue they would reply saying they could not locate my account. I called to close my account today and they couldnt find me at all this time. I waited an hour, called back and she had no problem locating my account, closing it and hanging up on me.

I became concerned about their cybersecurity since my card was used by someone else. They still required me to divulge my personal information before discussing the issue. Considering the breach, I believe they have very poor policies in place to handle harmful customer events. More fraudulent charges appeared after that. I spent my valuable time over more than one thirty minute call reporting these charges and Avant failed to remove them from the account through the dispute process. They are not a bank. They are AWFUL at handling customers. They even had the audacity to drop my credit limit with a note in the account that the customer was being rude or some such. This was later reversed in a tacit acknowledgement of their error. The complete ordeal was a massive waste of time and I ended up paying for someone elses Pizza (twice) just to close the account to prevent further breaches, wasted time, and disrespectful treatment. Their process is slow. Even after the final payment was posted they still prattled on about trying to collect a debt. Their incompetence is astonishing. I attempted to resolve the issue with their leaders by reaching out, but was ignored. Honestly, a terrible company. Would not recommend them to anyone. "

Without fail, I will authorize payment for double the minimum due within 10 days of receiving the statement.On December 17th, 2022 I checked the app and my statement had been generated. It showed the minimum balance due ($25) and the due date (January 13th, 2023). On that day (December 17th) I made a payment of $50. The payment was accepted and the funds were withdrawn from my checking account on December 20th, 2022.On January 14th, I was charged a $25 late fee for missing the due date of January 13th. When I called to find out what happened, I was informed that since I made my payment on the last day of my billing cycle, it did not count toward the January 13th due date. When I asked to speak to a supervisor, I was disconnected. Upon calling back, the second representative told me the same thing. Instead of working with me, both representatives argued with me insisting that it was my fault and that it would not be rectified. A \"request\" to reverse the late charge was processed and was denied.I have received 7 statements from Avant and I have bank records showing 7 payments for double my minimum within a few days of receiving each statement. This means I have NEVER missed a payment and have always been at least two weeks early. Yet since my most recent payment occurred the *** I received my statement, Avant claims it only goes toward the balance and does not satisfy the minimum due.Everyone I spoke to at Avant refused to help me. Both my emails went unanswered. When I received the email informing me that my request for a late fee reversal was denied, I immediately called Avant and closed my account. What kind of ****ed-up company refuses to help its customers? It's apparent that Avant is taking advantage of those of us with bad credit and we REALLY need to put them out of business."

This rep claimed to be a supervisor because I asked to speak with one Its now Jan 3, 2022 I spoke with a rep today first she said due to the weather my card was late, then she said a vendor is the reason the card was late and it can take up to 5 weeks meanwhile I have small bills coming off of this card I asked to speak to a supervisor she put me on hold then came back as usual no supervisor is available! This is how it is EVERYTIME i call. furthermore I was told when opening a credit card making on time payments for 6 months I can get credit increase this is not true. Instead of waiting for an imaginary card, pouring my money into something I will not benefit to build credit with this company I cant get help or answers when I need it! I just want to know when I pay off this small balance and close my card how long will that take? How will it affect my score? Do they do balance transfers? I guess with this company you gotta take your chances. I will pay off and cancel! The company always says escalating the issue but never no resolution. "

The last straw for me was them refusing to put an $80 payment in my \"Available Credit\" with the claimit had already been placed in my account. IT WAS NOT! My balance at the start of the month was $340. I paid them $80, spent $83, expecting the next $80 to be placed back on the card. They tell me that it takes ************************************* my Available Credit, which is very odd, in the first place (no other card I have does this). I paid them on the 3rd of Nov 2022, Since the 10th day this month came on a Sunday (not a business day), the payment never showed up. However, it did not come the following day either. I called the company, and the rep said that the $80 would be reflected in my Available Credit by the end of Nov 14. I accepted. The money never came. I called them again, and another rep tells me that the money was already placed on my card on the 3rd, which is a lie because my Available Credit NEVER reflected $80 being placed on it. This rep kept repeating that the payment \"posted\" on the 3rd, yet I tell her it never showed up in my Available Credit. She repeats the lie that it was available on the same day the payment posted. I tried explaining to her that the Available Credit never reflected the payment, and she soon hung up on me. I had issues with the company before, from them rejecting my bank account due to problems on thier site, to my purchases being flagged as fraudulent by thier automated system. I don't know if I've done the process right, but I immediately closed my account after realizing that they were going to continue to lie about the $80 that never showed up in my Available Credit. I'll pay what I oweThe company and its reps have always had a hint of negligence regarding me as customer. It all started with them rejecting a plentiful payment source they'd taken from, and it went down from there. "

Looking at other complaints this is apparently a pretty common thing with this company. Damaging my credit for being a good customer is disgusting. Avoid this company, I don't know what their angle is in signing people up and then damaging their credit but it is a horrible practice."

When I called asking why all they would say is that a letter was mailed out to my physical address and I should received it in **** business days. That was over 20 days ago and I have received nothing. If that wasnt enough of a red flag, looking through the app reviews, I noticed numerous complaints of them lowering credit limits all around the same time as mine happened. I had no late payments on my account according to my apps Home Screen. I only used it once for a purchase and paid it right off. I was saving it to purchase a vacation package. Now that idea is ruined. They responded to my complaint on the app asking me to call them. They refused to converse via email, and I work 12 out of 14 days so I dont have time to sit on the phone and argue with them. I want my original credit limit back, or I want them to refund the annual fee and close the account. This company has to be a scam given what Ive seen. "

Ive had Avant for over 2yrs and have been on time with my monthly payments and have even, on numerous occasions, sent lump sums to ensure I stayed under the 30% utilization rate. All of this for them to decrease my credit limit from $1000 to $300. This dropped my credit score tremendously!! I barely even used the card. I only got it to increase my credit score. I will be paying it in full and I will never use it. I think there should be a class action suit against Avant. I will definitely be looking into it. "

I would have NEVER allowed someone to pull my credit for a credit card with a $ 300 limit.

Their customer service is worthless and lie to you because they are clueless. I had autopay set up and made extra payments throughout the month if I used this very high interest card. Not once was I late and am grateful I didnt owe too much to pay them off. Will definitely cut this card up. Not sure who Im more disappointed with - Avant LLC or the BBB for giving them a A rating.

No problem my account is in good standing and the credit card accepting the transfer has a much lower interest rate than Avant.  The rep placed me on hold for 10 minutes.  When she returned, she stated that Avant does not do balance transfers however they accept balance transfers from other credit card companies. I informed her that the information she provided was NOT in my contract agreement with Avant.  I requested for the information to be mailed or emailed to me and she said that couldn't because its Avant's internal policy.  I requested to speak to a supervisor.

  "body": "If I could give zero stars I would. I rarely use this card, but put a couple of purchases on it in May because using credit is supposed to increase my credit score (total scam btw). In June, I paid the balance off. Two weeks later, I get an email that I've missed a payment, so I paid the new balance, and figured I'd just leave the overpayment to go towards my streaming service. They still cannot find my June payment, even though it cleared my bank two days later.  I have called them 4 times and emailed them proof of payment TWICE. Twice I was told that my issue would be 'escalated' and someone would contact me.Today I got a auto-email that said 'It looks like we assisted you over the phone.' THEY HAVE NOT. As soon as I can get these idiots to acknowledge their error and credit my account, I'm closing it. STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY!! "

  "body": "Avant is sketchy to say the least. Upon opening an account- their website looks totally normal and like a legitimate bank. Plenty of information, content, all the right menu options, perks, services, security, etc. Once approved, their app, at face value, appears completely normal as well, containing all of the right verbiage and visuals to make you not think twice about their legitimacy.  However, when you see fraudulant charges on your statement and attempt to handle the situation, it becomes very clear that this is NOT your average credit card company.Their \"lock your card from your app, instantly\" is a lie. When you click the button to do so, it provides you a phone number. No matter what resource you're looking for on your account, all buttons direct you back to a phone number. When calling it becomes even more clear this is some kind of back ***** operation and is completely suspicious. The hold music is out of a horror movie and ive learned Avant truly doesnt have any real employees or departments. They have a call center of people who answer for several companies just like Avant and then will transfer you to another \"department\" where the person answering is also not employed by Avant. Just a completely suspect operation all together. Really makes you question things. We're so worried about protecting our information and money yet blindly give it to companies like this who are making a killing taking advantage of our sense of security with banks yet I cant help but question if companies like Avant are the ones we should fear. I would be SHOCKED if I got my money back on the 7 fraudulent transactions.The my card was used more than 600 miles away from anywhere I have ever used my card yet I received no warning emails, calls, texts, etc. and my card was not frozen. It has taken me 2 weeks to get in touch with anyone in the fraud \"department\" and even that was a completely weird process/conversation.I absolutely would not recommend this company. "

I did not receive verbal or written notification when additional documents were requested. I would only find out about my loan status when I would log onto my online account. Requested documents were submitted within the same day. Several representatives confirmed that a decision would be made in 3 days and then changed to 7 days. It is now the 8th day and no decision. Oh the rhetorical questions drove me up the wall. Simple verification does not take more than 3 days to approve the loan. Not sure what the hold up is since I was already pre-approved. I requested corporates phone number,  the customer service rep stated she was not at discretion to give out. The *** ******* Bochener needs to send his employees through a customer service etiquette training. "

I did not authorize two payments in the amount of $100 each from my account. I received an email for each transaction which let me know that the payment was coming out.  Because I am very good with paying my bills on time, I thought maybe for the June payment I had set up the payment on an earlier date and just forgot. I waited until this month to confirm if my speculations were correct; I had not set up a payment and the monies are pending in my account for a payment. I made a call to the company because I did not set up those payments. I received an email on 7/15 (5/15 also) that instructed me to call the company before noon central time to have the payment changed or cancel the authorization.  I spoke to Biance on 7/16 who told me the payment is pending but she could not do anything and had to escalate my call. She escalated my call to her supervisor ****** who then informs me it will take 14 days for the escalation team to review. I had two questions for the supervisor; please point me in the right direction on the website where I set up the payment and why does it not show any scheduled payments nor recurring payments?  I will allow the state to investigate, and I would like to open a case for the SEC to look at this company because I know I am not the only customer this is happening to. Biance attempted to tell me to have my bank reverse the charges - that should not have been her response when I am following the instructions on the email. I did take care of disputing the charge with my bank and I also had them close my account. Also, the website does not allow you to remove your card as a payment and it does not allow you to make any changes on payments pending.  Biance did remove my card from the account.  This is very illegal and bad practice for this business. "

The issue started on July 7, 2022, when I logged in to check my account. I noticed a red flag across my account stating that my account was blocked. I called to see what was going on after waiting on hold for 40 minutes. I was told that there was a fraud charge on my account. I confirm that it wasn't fraud and that I had made the purchase. If I never checked my account I would've never known this even existed because they didn't reach out. After being on the phone for almost 1.5 hours it was finally escalated to a supervisor and she contacted the fraud department. Usually, with a suspected fraud charge they reach out and ask if it was you. I told her I did not need a new card because it was a purchase I made and do NOT send me another card. The supervisor escalated this situation to her supervisor. She told me instead of waiting 2 business days to have this resolved it would be resolved by COB which would be no later than 11 pm EST. The next day on 7-8 I noticed I had the blocked red banner off of m account I attempted to make an amazon purchase and it was declined. I called and was told my card was active but the purchase was declined because all cardholders are unable to make online transactions. I was able to use my card 7-9,7-10, and 11 with no issues. On ****, I made an online Jersey **** transaction and it was approved. I went to the grocery store that was declined and attempted to make an ezpass purchase which was declined. The code I received was suspected fraud. I called the company again and they said oh your card doesn't work because we sent a new one. This is all after the supervisor removed the hold and me being able to use my card every day since.If I could erase this whole account I would. Now I owe them money of course but I wish I NEVER OPENED THIS ACCOUNT.I DO NOT RECOMMEND AT ALL!!! PLEASE AVOID!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

They say I've paid this fee before. They also say they \"don't know what I signed up for,\" but my agreement shows a $32 fee.

I did that & I was told to call a different number which sent me to the same call center I already spoke to.

I received a response from the inquiry that stated the credited amount would show on my dashboard as of May 1st. Today is 5/16/22 and STILL no credit. I called back and the rep began to spew out her scripted response. I finally told the rep that they were the worst credit card company on the planet earth and that I would be closing my account.

I called Avant and they referred my complaint to their fraud division -- I have not heard from them yet. The number for Avant listed on the credit report was a dead number -- I had to find their number on their website. They said they would get back to me but as I see in other reviews here -- I might be waiting a long time. I filed a report with the *** and with my local police department.

I checked my statement days later and my payment was posted, however, it was not reflecting in my available credit.  I called to inquire and was told that although my payment was posted and my balance owed is zero - my available credit will not update to my credit limit for 10 days.  I asked why it took 10 days when the money was taken from my account immediately and was told that was their policy.  I told them I wanted to closed my account and was told that I may have to pay a penalty if I closed my account.  I'm not understanding how a company can receive payment, acknowledge the payment but not credit your account for 10 Days???  The representative kept talking over me and script reading, she wasn't hearing my concerns.  Needless to say I closed the account and strongly advise anyone to NOT go through this company.....shady business!  I only marked one star because negative 20 wasnt available"

As a courtesy to WebBank, I made charges using the credit card, but when I try to pay extra above the minimum, which is the autopay, too frequently I cant get to my account on the Avant Mobile App. This morning, 3/25/2022, I tried to open the app using Face Recognition plus the password, and the screen says my account has been locked due to suspicious activity, and directs me to call the number listed, which is an automated attendant. I was asked to enter my DOB plus the last 4 digits of SS, which I did. I tried to check the balance, the music came on, and I never got a response in 5 minutes, checked using the time on my iPhone. This is not the first time this has happened "

  "body": "I received an alert that someone had placed a credit inquiry on my account--the name was Webbank/Avant LLC. I hadn't applied for a loan or tried to open an account. I called Avant LLC immediately, and they said their fraud department would get back to me in 5-7 business days. In the meantime I put a freeze on all of my accounts, filed a police report, and watched my accounts like a hawk. Of course my credit score had decreased. Over a week later I received a request that I submit a bunch of paperwork to them, file a report with the **** get a document notarized, etc. I did all of that, sent it off a few weeks ago, and haven't heard a peep from their fraud department. Yesterday I received an alert that the credit card account with Avant is open, and there is a $39.00 charge, (from everything I'm reading from similar situations it's a fee.) At this conjuncture, it is clear they haven't done anything to stop this person from opening the account. Weirdly, this person took out the account with an old address and my maiden name--it's pretty clear Avant doesn't actually do a proper credit/background check. Now I have account disputes going with Transunion, Equifax, and Experian to get this matter resolved. I am incredibly freaked out, frustrated, and disturbed by this company's practices, and I hope they will be shut down soon, because everyone seems to be encountering fraudulent accounts with them. "

I immediately called in and reported  my lost card and the charges that were not from me. I was transferred to the fraud department where I explained and pointed out all those charges that were not from me. I was told someone might contact me for more information and a full investigation would be conducted. On february 8th I receive a letter stating that the investigation was complete in less than 2 weeks and a decision was made making me responsible for all charges.I have been trying to contact someone (S..... from the ***** MANAGEMENT TEAM but oddly her phone goes directly to voicemail and she NEVER CALL BACK.even as I have left multiple voice messages stating this is a urgent matter . I am completely devastated and disappointed in your company which also seems a bit sketchy being that there are over 300 complaints similar to my situation on the BBB website. I've never heard of a company that have a DEPARTMENT MANAGER  that #1 has no last name on the letter at all & #2 phones go straight to voicemail and never return calls. I would hope to have this matter resolved as soon as possible and speak to someone who can really conduct an investigation and replace my money back on my card because I am a VICTIM. As I read all these other customer complaints so similar to mines I Hope that this company finally get shut down and we all get justice in these matters. This is so unfair and flat out robbery! "

Someone had opened an account with Avant without knowing, as the status stated, \"WEBBANKAVANT\".  I called WebBank through the number on their website.  The person help me close the account, however every time I asked for information about the account, like the type of account it was, what was the balance, where was the transaction made; I was put on hold for 2-3 minutes.  After the account was \"closed\" (which I have no verification is was closed), they \"transferred\" me to credit services, which I was on hold for about 5 minutes an then the call was dropped.  When calling back, I chose the option that sounded like credit services.  That person notified me that it needed to be dealt by Avant, which it seemed she was not.  She transferred me to \"credit services\".  The next person told me that I needed to speak with ID Fraud and gave me another phone number to call, which resolved to Metro Credit Union in ******, which seemed odd that I was speaking to a place near where the transaction took place.  A person answered the phone, asked my name, and then put me on a long hold.  Someone different eventually picked up, they \"registered\" my fraud claim and stated that the fraud department would contact me \"via email\" in 5 days.  When asking for a phone number for the fraud department to be able to call if I did not receive correspondence in 5 days, they told me I could only email them.After speaking with 5 different people, I am still unsure if my account was closed nor if my ID theft / fraud was registered.For a company that specifically states that they take security seriously, the maze of calls did not give the impression.  The people themselves sounded sympathetic, however without confirmation that my time was valued by the company, it all seems useless.  I have little faith that I will receive an email in 5 days"

Oh yeah the lady on the phone caused me of lying because on own the home where it was received. That's true, but I never lived in the home until recently it was a weekly rental to travelers visiting the nearby national park. That doesn't matter either, because I never applied or accepted credit from these clowns. I'll roll the dice before I higher an attorney. Until then they can kiss my.. "

No one asked can I take your number and have a member call me back? No one said here is an email address, please send us a message. Alas I was just asked if someone was listening to our call. Extremely unprofessional! I imagine they would be concerned if someone is listening. I read a review about this companies predatory practices and I can definitely concur. Avant contacted me with this pre approved nightmare.   As a customer who is no longer confident in this institutions ability to serve my financial needs.

I started with a 4K loan and halfway through payment, they reached out and asked it I would like more funds. I accepted and was given a **** loan. Payment plan of 339 dollars for three years. I paid every single payment on time for three years, paying and making the last payment on July 19, 2021. All payments were auto enrolled, which made it convenient.On September 9, 2021, I received an email from Avant, that I had an outstanding balance with interest. I was confused as I paid off the loan in July. In looking at my account, it stated that I had only paid 94% of the principal loan and still owed  $402 dollars and no payment was scheduled as July was my last one. After contacting customer support, they come up with a story that I changed a date in 2018 and the 400 dollars accumulated over the three years. However, in looking at all my payments over the three years, not one of them are missing or changed. I also asked for it in writing  where I supposedly changed this date. The agent said that was impossible since it was a verbal agreement. What a load of c*** How can I not be notified two months after payoff that I still owe and drawing interest? I no longer trust this company and I would not do business as well. Buyer Beware!"

They got me the money in a very timely manner and the customer service was great. After a while, I was placed in a bad position when purchasing a house. I fell into collections with Avant. They were still courteous and helped all they could to help get and keep me on track. Another while later, I lost my job and my house. I had lost the ability to pay anyone during this time. I never heard from Avant. But they continued to report me good on my credit report. I vowed to repay that last little bit that I owed them when I found another job but I was never able to keep the job long enough to get to a point to repay that final amount. Yet, they continued to report good on my credit report and never tried to collect it. Fast forward to today, I have been on my current job for the past six months and I was putting Avant in my plans to pay the last payment on this loan. I get an email saying that the final amount has been forgiven! I was floored. I am almost in tears writing this because I really wanted to do right by this company to settle the debt as gratitude for the way they have treated me. I am not saying that they will do this for everyone, but as for me, I cannot thank Avant enough for this and your service and patience with me over the past few years. I am very sorry that I fell just short of completing this loan. I still intend to write a direct letter to the customer service department giving my sincerest gratitude for this. After this, I would recommend Avant, LLC to anyone who needs a loan. No company is perfect, but with effort, kindness, and willingness to resolve your issues, there are businesses that will work with their customers for the benefit of both parties. Thank you again Avant for everything!!"

You don't tell a client you can only apply once lmaoooooooo. You don't say, without a credit license, apply for a credit line increase after 6 months ****. Anyway, that was my experience with terrible customer service, not being able to apply twice, and just remember, the app is beautiful, excellent job done. Thank you."

I am disabled with no kids and I'm a victim of domestic violence even though there's supposed to be so many options available to me, there is not! I don't have the money nor the time to drag it through court. I don't think these PREDATORY scams are at all right. I know it's a scam to continuously run and lower my credit score in an attempt to try and sell me on some \"credit repair\" nonsense that I have to pay for!!! If I'm in need of an EMERGENCY Loan, I definitely don't need a new monthly payment or to have OneMain continuously pulling from (creating negative marks on) my credit. When you already have the knowledge, you have no intention on providing me with a loan. Here's where the SCAM comes into play... Since I applied previously this letter is designed to make you believe there's an opportunity being offered. Even the fine print on the back is very ambiguous to lure you in. I read carefully and responded with my offer code... Gave you all my intimately personal information, AGAIN! Why? You got me to respond to your offer for what? To Phish My information some MORE!??? Creating more spam for me and the possibility of having my identity stolen AGAIN! BECAUSE you don't just sell my information to legit \"reputable\" sources either. Read the fine print before you do ANYTHING with this company!"

All of a sudden a paid off car that they didn&rsquo;t know about was now the only option for me to get funds.

Boy was I wrong.\nIn a review of my monthly credit I discovered that there was still a balance of $25.00. I logged in to their website again to see a balance of like $25.23. In small print (this time) there was indication that this is not the payoff amount (hem why not?). So of course I was pissed, I called in and the payoff amount was 26.09, more than what was indicated on their site.\nI reckon they don't want you to pay them off, ever."

When I asked for help they where quick to try to help to defer your payment, don&rsquo;t do it! The payments we made only where going to the interest and not the principal. Our loan was supposed to be paid off in February, and bc I did some deferments apparently we screwed ourselves. Oh and when you defer you don&rsquo;t pay the interest until the end of the loan it&rsquo;s a separate payment. This company is a joke, I would not recommend this company to anyone. They thrive off screwing people over and charging high interest rates!"

  "body": "Initially, I believed to have a good relationship but quickly soured when I was solicitated with an offer for loan refinance/cash out. Although I have requested specific reasons why I was denied there was discussion between LaTonya and I then subsequently Eric. It was discussed that I was denied due to being homeless or not being able to verify an address via a credit report. I was also told length of time on my current job and purportedly an issue with payment history. If this weren't enough and but for my persistency, I asked what Credit Bureau was used  for which initially LaTonya wouldn't disclosed. However, my credit monitoring services alerted me to all (3) reports being utilized. Yet, Eric said they only used one; but hard inquiries were initiated with all (3) albeit they alleged they only used Experian. Despite proof to the contrary, they are unwillling to remove/correct my bureau files of Equifax and TransUnion as it is unfair to use all three bureaus when you state you only used Experian."

Very very fast and Maggie helped me SOOOOO much, I appreciated her so much for breaking everything down for me and being so incredibly patient with me and the questions I had. Getting the money was super fast too. Applied one day, answered questions that same day I applied, made an appointment to come in person to sign papers and next day had the money.

After making my regular payment for January I made an extra payment which would have brought my account balance down to 4more payment.  When I checked my statement it showed the payment had not posted. I called the *********&nbsp;Ga. branch and spoke with a very nasty lady who informed me the payment was made from the wrong bank account..  I explained that was impossible because I signed into my account online and paid with the info that was already set in my account. The same bank info that I made my regular payment with is the same bank info that I made the extra payment with just 7 days earlier!  This company has account people who are nasty and tell lies!  Do not do business with them.  They do not want you to pay off your loan.  The longer you pay the more money they make!!!!!"

On Friday I applied for a loan and gave the loan officer, Jeff from the **********&nbsp;office on *********&nbsp;Rd., correct information regarding my husband&rsquo;s and my income. Jeff had told me I was approved and to just send in the supporting documentation. Once that was received, he said my money would be in my account that night. Well, I provided the documentation no less than 30 minutes after we got off the phone. I didn&rsquo;t hear from nor did he pick up when I called later that day so, I left a message. I waiting until this afternoon to see if he received the documentation and he still had not called me back. So, I called him and because of a mistake on HIS end, he told me I was denied. Please tell me how I am prequalified and get approved on Friday but, because of an incompetent employee like Jeff, I get denied today? BEWARE of OneMain Financial. I will never think about using them and I recommend no one does."

However, I was unaware at the time, that the auto title was to use as collateral, and that I didn't know that One Main paid off my auto loan to secure my vehicle. I did not realize that they would add themselves to my title, and now they are wanting to take over the auto insurance on the car as well. It also upsets me that I never see my loan amount go down, and that One Main will not use full disclosure with me so that I can easily see what I owe, where my payments are being applied and when I can anticipate paying the loan off. I feel that the loan process was predatory because of the lack of clarity from One Main related to the lending process. I would not recommend anyone to do business with One Main Financial. I never missed a payment yet they are saying that I owed a late fee the sum of which is almost the amount of my payment. I would suggest that anyone should run not walk away from this company.\nI will also be sending a copy to the Federal Trade Commission for them to look into this company."

And was told that all my offers were indeed legit.\nWas told all my documents were solid, and that my income and debt ratio was great and there should be no issues.\nHowever I was denied last second, with no true explanation as to why I was denied and that it was a \"management decision\".\nEven the lender employee who did my application was surprised that I was denied. He told me you make good money and all documents checked out and didn't understand why I was denied himself.\nI complained to onemain customer service, and was contacted by a representative. They looked in to my application and confrimed as well income and documents were solid. And told me the reason I was denied was because they could not \"verify my income\".\nI'm mind boggled by this, as I sent not 2 but 4 pay stubs. Even one with my last stub of the year that has my end of year totals.\nI asked if there was a way we could fix the issue and i would do what ever was needed to verify my source of income. But was told that unfortunately the loan was closed already.. and that I'd have to apply again.\nWhat blows my mind is all the unsecured loans and low apr offers completely dissapeared.. went from\n-15-18% APR, unsecured, outstanding approval odds, over 20 different offers...to\n-29-31% APR, only secured, and down to 5 offers and fair odds.\nAll this changed right after I was denied.\nI don't understand why I was not contacted right away to fix this minor issue. Instead was just told they could not go back to the offer I choose.\nHow can my income not be verified? when I sent 4 legit pay stubs. And my company is a nation wide company.\nFor them to be like, oh well, better luck next. Instead of working with me to fix a issue that was their problem, not mine. Is just terrible business. And are not true lenders."

  "body": "Well after taking the time to fill out the application online and through a 2 week time frame due to them having information incorrect. I was finally started with the actual loan process. I put in the notes about a disability I have to which I told them about multiple times, but after them approving everything they stated I need to be present to which I expressed that I had already informed them I could not be. But could have a notary appear and we could do all paperwork through the notary and after providing proof of my disability as requested by them. They did not reach back out. So I called them again and informed them I had submitted the documents after they said they had a 25 day time line for the start and finish of loans and said they would proceed with the loan application so my notary that handles this stuff for me took off work and was ready to bring the collateral and do the paperwork and all and I called them as they requested to which they stated the application had closed in the system and they would call me back that day and they never did. The gas lighting and ability to not accomadate a disability is rediculous. since so much is done online these days anyway. I had everything ready no cost to them and they still acted like their company policy out trumps disability laws and requirements for businesses. Highly dissappointed with this branch. I wish I could give a no star review. So if you have a disability know this company may not accomadate and will likely wait out their \"application\" time frame. There were many other things that happened during this time frame between myself and the company but to shorten the review i summed it up. Still waiting for my call back I figure I'll never receive."

The insurance company made the FULL payments, but OneMain continued to also pull it from my account.\nI am currently paid ahead until March 1st.\nThis morning I spoke to find ANOTHER $285.50 taken from my account even though my online account and statement both state I'm paid ahead until 3/1/24. This payment they took today caused my electric bill to bounce. I'm completely disabled and have a small child, and they won't give me the money back. They have taken $856.50 out of my account since October that wasn't owed to them. DO NOT USE THIS LOAN COMPANY. THEY ARE THIEVES!!!"

  "body": "******* Illinois location\nI have been paying my loan on time for 3  years. My total has yet to drop more than $1500. My payment are $400 a month so I&rsquo;m confused on why it hasn&rsquo;t dropped. I ended up on a STD leave from work and called onemain to explain I havent been working. Since I was paying extra for the unemployment gap I figured that would be a great time to use it. The worker I spoke with said I couldnt use it unless I was fired. With that being said I ask to remove the unemployment charge from my loan. She processed with &ldquo;why can&rsquo;t you ask your boyfriend to pay it?&rdquo; I said excuse me? She said &ldquo;well I&rsquo;m just trying to give you different options.&rdquo; She gave me the hardest time removing the gap, I had to call the 800 number instead. Months later, I wanted to sell the vehicle due to financial hardship and convince them to give me the title back. Again, I am going through a financial situation and I explain that to them. I tried to refinance to try to lower my monthly payment. The Manager I spoke with didn&rsquo;t let me even attempt to refinance. He didn&rsquo;t want to help in any time of way. I explained I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to make my payment on time and he basically ignored me. Now, my due date is here and I can&rsquo;t pay it and he calls me over 10 times a day. Now I&rsquo;m getting letters saying they will sue me yet I explain my situation and got no help. I stopped answering calls because they just keep harassing me for a payment and unfortunately I just can&rsquo;t do it. They had no solution for me while on the phone with them but send me emails about lowering my payment. When I ask they don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m talking about."

The email stated I was eligible for a loan from $7500 - $14,000 depending on my current credit standing. Being an existing customer of there&rsquo;s, I agreed to the stipulations and proceeded with the process and completed the application. My credit was checked, and I took a hard inquiry hit to my beacon score. I waited a few days and after being approved, I was told then that in the state of Florida, I was only eligible for a lower dollar amount loan than the one specified in the original email. I&rsquo;ve been waiting days for a response on how to handle the issue, with no resolution. I tried calling several times and no one from the One Main Financial offices has made an attempt to assist with the issue."

I used my personal vehicle as collateral on this loan and then, unfortunately, my vehicle was totaled in an accident while out of the state caused by a truck driver. They had NO problem collecting the check from the insurance company to satisfy the loan and didn't bother to call and tell me the insurance company had called them directly.  Any phone calls to work with me totally stopped. Knowing that I would need monies for a down payment on a new vehicle, I applied solely for a new loan. I was denied.

I paid the first two off early so I was told it wouldn't help my credit. Paid the third one off on time, not one payment late and my score dropped over 100 points. Can't get a card, can't get a loan, nothing because my score dropped. So, this credit building company sent me info that I qualified a loan through one main. Gave them all my private info from my home I own, cars I own, how much I make, let them look inside my private bank account and I had to give my social security account. To be told I can't have a loan because I would have to give them a car I own for a loan. That is insane. I paid for my car. Why would I sign it over to you for 5k$ on a loan so I can rebuild my credit?  It isn't heinous. I've gotten loans And purchased cars with less credit. Definitely a scam and how they have everything they need to steal everything I own. I told the woman who called claiming to rep the company that was a ludicrous suggestion and why send something saying I qualify when you are just trying to take my car?  Not reputable at all and I definitely regret giving them my info thinking they were a real bank"

Yes I was approved. I have an average credit score of 750 with no late payments or defaults in loans and credit cards. They send a prequalified offer of 14.45%. You apply and get approved and guess what it jumps to 18.6% for 5 years. Not bad almost $3500 interest. Not bad for someone that is desperate that is. I asked where the 15.4% I was offered at 60 months. She said hold on and come back and said I can do that at 36 months and your payment go up at almost $100 month. lol. If you&rsquo;re even semi educated you can see where I&rsquo;m going with this. Never ever believe those prequalified offers because once you apply you can&rsquo;t get the inquiry off your credit report even when approved. That my friend is called bait and switch. You know who you are. I seen her name in a couple of negative reviews."

My take home pay is descent but I needed a small personal loan that I know I could payoff quickly. Also, I had a previous loan some years ago with onemain that was paid off.  So the first customer service rep wasn&rsquo;t making any sense to me to denied me over the phone even though I was approved for the amount above.  Note: So, I requested to speak to a supervisor and she said that he wasn&rsquo;t available and she was trying to get me off the phone by saying have a good day but I repeatedly asked for a supervisor. Another person got on the phone which it was a woman and both were white women said that they could not approve me for anything and that I will receive a letter stating why I was denied&hellip;"

Everyone was giving me numbers to people who couldn't help or transfer me to people who couldn't help. The worst of them all was a supervisor by the name of Kelvin C*****. He cut me off multiple times when I was speaking, yelled at me and told me I don't know how things work because I don't work at One Main.

They prey on people trying to work on their debt, they bank on the fact that the average person does not understand their jargon.

I called back and was told they needed to do another soft pull. Afterwards, they said I did qualify for that loan ( although nothing had changed) and that my only option was a program that required me to default on all my credit cards payments. This naturally brought up more questions. At this point the rep hung up on me once she sensed I wasn&rsquo;t going to take the loan. I called back annoyed but calm to explain the situation. The second rep would not provide his name and hung up on me a second time. This company will hold your debt over head and use fear as a motivator to bait and switch whatever product they&rsquo;re pushing. DO NOT use this company."

  "body": "Hi, to whom it may concern\nI hope this message finds you well. I'm writing to address a pressing concern regarding a recent double car payment. On November 30th, 2023, I inadvertently submitted two payments and called my local branch explaining this. The representative sent me a 'test' emailing showing my bank statements that the payment had came through I promptly responded to your team's email seeking a refund. Regrettably, I haven't received any updates or acknowledgment since.\nWith December's payment scheduled for autodraft on the 30th, it's crucial to resolve this matter promptly. I'm left uncertain about the status of my refund and concerned about its impact on my finances.\nCould you please prioritize and provide an update at your earliest convenience? Your prompt attention to this issue is greatly appreciated.\nThank you"

After losing my job and now working with a lower income , I found out that there is a limit to what the insurance pays out. even though one signs the contract the consumer is NOT AWARE of the true nature of what the insurance covers. The just tell you, it covers your loan amount if you lose your job. This is NOT the case. buyers beware."

  "body": "Customer Service dumpster fire. I'm in Sales/CS so I'm patient with these things, but OneMain reps seemingly avoid divulging pertinent info and found ways to take more money without benefitting me or my loan.\nFirst rep I spoke with said principal reduction payments aren't accepted.\n2nd rep scheduled my auto draft exceeding the monthly amount due (again told I can't allocate any funds specifically toward principal).\n3rd rep said to call a couple days before auto draft to ensure funds are allocated toward principal (can't be done within the app, of course).\nI called before my auto draft, was told by a (4th) rep I'd have to cancel the auto draft and make payment that day(?), so I did and paid over TWICE the amount due.\nWeeks later, I'm bombard with calls claiming my payment is late and I owe $175 in interest to avoid late fees. The handful of reps I spoke with (despite my laundry list of questions) failed to communicate that the monthly amount due HAS to be allocated toward default interest/principal settings, but principal reduction payments CAN be made IN ADDITION to that.\nAnother obstacle, I changed my payment method in the app but OneMain drafted my old payment method, resulting in overdraft fees (from a now unused bank account) AND late fees from OneMain. Beware- OneMain will not email/call if payment declines, but instead repeatedly draft your account on random dates. I called (a 5th rep) to update my payment method, to later discover my old payment method was drafted AGAIN..\nAs someone very proactive with payments, the lack of transparency/follow-through from CS and app malfunctions made it impossible to stay ahead. It's even harder to trust my account is in good hands when one rep claims I owe fees while another claims I don't. I've lost money making payments that could've been allocated differently for over a year, money to overdraft fees, and a lot of time to resolving CS issues. Luckily my home office rep is amazing and advised to avoid CS."

That student loan is throwing your debt/ income ratio off.\"  My student loans have been in deferment for over 10 years.  I recertify every year,  and it continues to be deferred.\nI have documentation to verify that.  Melissa stated okay great can you send it over to me.   I asked (before I send this letter) if the letter needed to state my deferment for 1 year or did I need to recertify real quick to have the date changed on the letter for it to reflect the duration of the loan she was offering me.  She stated,  \"Just send in what you have.   You're already approved so by showing you have no student loan payment we can get this done today.   Nevertheless,  I would normally say at least 2 years but I've also seen where 1 year is sufficient so we should be fine. \"\nI sent in the student loan letter that clearly states deferment until 09/24/2024.  I called Melissa back and she stated I'm sorry the letter needs to reflect 2 years of deferred payments.   I asked,  \"So you are telling me I'm denied when it was YOU that told me what I had should be sufficient... otherwise I would have recertified to get you what is required.\"    She said, Yes.   It's denied.  I'm sorry.\"\nI can take rejection,  but what I cannot accept is being told numerous times I am approved.  Then stating just send me the deferred letter of what you currently have should be sufficient.   Then denying me for what SHE told me would be sufficient.  A total waste of my time and unnecessary hit to my credit because Melissa was UNSURE of how to direct me properly.  Proper job education is a MUST!!"

I called the guy at the car lot he told me that he's putting a warranty on the car &amp; that I either had to drive 1000 miles or wait 30 days for them to honour the warranty however he never provided with with the warranty information until July, finally at the end of July which was 2 months of having the car the transmission completely went out. Come to find out the warranty didn't even cover the transmission I had because it is a CVT transmission. So I explain to One Main the whole situation they weren't trying to hear anything I'm telling them, all they kept screaming to me is money, money, money, money, money. The car I end up finding out had mold coming up from the floors I've explained that they didn't care one bit. So I told them that I wanted to do a volunteer repossession she said she'll have to check with someone &amp; see if the car is eligible. She called me back the next day saying the car isn't eligible for volunteer repossession, I explained to them I don't want the car &amp; I honestly feel like one main was in the business of playing games because, I explained the situation to one person they seemed to care &amp; swear they're gonna file a report against the car lot, then I'll get a call from someone demanding money or of you. This place is the DEVIL!!!!"

He used his truck as collateral for a loan and it was almost paid off. I never received anything in the mail in reference to the loan. I am his POA and I eventually emailed the company to have someone contact me with information they were needing. Never heard anything in any type of communication. I showed up at my dad's old place where he had lived before living with me and found the truck gone. I called One Main and they proceeded to tell me, since I was not on the loan, they were unable to tell me anything and that they had mailed out a letter to his physical address where the truck was located. His physical address never had a mail receptacle and he had always had a PO Box for a mailing address and again, I told them my address for any information because he had lived with me for 8 months until he passed away. The truck was REPOED with no information given to me to find out what was needed. I never had the chance to clean his truck out with all his personal belongings before it was taken from the driveway. They had no grief or care during the conversations I had with all the people I spoke with on the phone. I would NEVER use this company for anything EVER. They only take money and I probably won't see the money they get for selling the truck for over the amount he owed them. They are thieves and have no remorse or compassion."

I highly recommend OneMain Financial for your loan needs.\nI've been reading the reviews of OMF and I must say I'm surprised to read of \"deceptive\" practices and rude people. Here at the *********&nbsp;WI OMF, I was treated with respect and kindness! The staff member who helped me was relatively new, but she was helped along the way. I don't mind this at all; in fact, I'd rather have someone sit in on a real person and learn from that, just like teaching hospitals do with students!\nI, personally, thought my experience with OMF was definitely very good!"

They are going to take all of my insurance payout and I will be carless. Even after telling them I have two kids and a mother with stage 2 parkinsons they had no empathy or pther options. I understand there is a contract but I would have been willing to do anything necessary to resolve this situation. I even advised I would happily put my next car as collateral to keep everything and had every intention of paying back as agreed. This is very upsetting as an already horrible life sitaution is made worse by them not willing to work with me. The agent even tried to tell me the \"benefits\" of them taking the entire payout, leaving me with nothing."

It's like management just throws them to the wolves to let them fend for themselves. My loan amount has not changed in three years.  The interest rate is higher than before. Omf is not a bad company.

If you absolutely must obtain a Title loan go through someone else and whomever you decide to open an account with, make sure you read the fine print in full detail.

I recently had to file an insurance claim on my vehicle for hail damage repairs. One Main has decided that due to the &ldquo;fine print&rdquo; in initial loan agreement I must give them the $10,000 check (issued to me by my car insurance provider for repairs) and have advised that I &ldquo;pay for the repairs myself out of pocket&rdquo; because they have a &ldquo;vested interest&rdquo; in the vehicle. I&rsquo;d like to also add that I&rsquo;ve had an active loan with One Main for four years and have never once fallen behind on payments. Not only are they forcing me to hand over the check issued to me by my insurance provider for repairs (which will then pay off over half of my loan to One Main) they have advised they cannot in turn lower monthly payments on the remaining smaller balance. I have spoken to their corporate office and everyone in between. They do not care. This is how they treat good customers no matter the circumstances. Do NOT sign a contract with them. Very bad business practices. For lack of better words, you will be screwed over and strong-armed if ever in need of car repairs."

I was approved for a Loan, only after having using my car as collateral. Conveniently for OneMain Financial, my car ate up most of the loan and left me with little to apply towards credit cards and other debt. Months later (10/12/23), I received a letter from OneMain Financial for an \"Invitation to Apply for a secured RENEWAL for $2,229.\" So, I applied! I needed it, and they knew I did. ;-) Of course, I wanted to try. That would have helped with paying off a lot more.\nFrom the numerous conversations I had with the reps from OneMain Financial within those wonderful 4 hours, I was under the impression that everything was running smoothly. I was even told that my \"odds were high because I was making payments EARLY up until this point.\" Unfortunately, after all the phone tagging and verification, my loan wasn't approved. Now, I have another HARD INQUIRY. and a current loan that is killing me with their 29.999% interest rate.\nTHANKS, OneMain Financial! You surely assisted me in screwing this one up.As humiliated as I feel, I'm taking this as a learning experience on my way to financial recovery.\nOneMain Financial, your policies &amp; methods do more harm than good to your customers. I can't wait to pay this loan off and be rid of ONE Main Financial!\nIf you're indecisive about going with OneMain Financial, I'll help, DON'T DO IT!!!!! You'll end up paying so much more &amp; kicking yourself in the butt for making matters worse!"

I get a call today from a representative from the *********&nbsp;California branch saying that I am always late when they have my due date for the first of every month and A direct debit for the 25th of every month. They say when you withdraw it five days before it makes you on time, but they are saying that I accrued all of these late fees which is totally not my fault. When I told them, they need to make it on the day that they want me to withdraw the money which is the first so I don&rsquo;t keep accruing these late fees, which is their fault and they told me that it would be OK, but they were still not able to explain properly to me about what was happening. I really don&rsquo;t appreciate being deceived and not having an understanding of what I&rsquo;m going through and being frustrated. Had this Loan for a long time but I promise you I&rsquo;m going to fight hard to pay it off. I am totally done"

I proceeded with what was stated as a soft inquiry, which was completely false.  Next thing you know I&rsquo;m brought to an application where they&rsquo;re requesting all of these documents. As a result of that, something told me not to move forward because why would these documents be requesting. I immediately X out and shortly after, I receive a phone call from someone telling me if I want to move forward with a request for a loan I would need my vehicle as collateral. I informed the representative that I would not move forward, the whole purpose of this loan was to consolidate some items and end up in a better position, not worse. Next thing, I receive notifications that a hard inquiry is reported and my credit was impacted. Then a few days later, I receive an email from them saying my loan was denied, how??! When I never moved forward. Complete scam and misleading, now I&rsquo;m impacting negatively because of them moving forward with a hard inquiry. Don&rsquo;t be fooled by FALSE pre-approvals and lies that it won&rsquo;t be a hard inquiry. Recommend everyone to stay away."

Our past experiences with One Main have always been positive, which is why we've been returning. However, this recent encounter has left us with no choice but to explore other options that value our time and patronage. If handling pressure and fulfilling promises, such as returning calls promptly, is a challenge, perhaps a career change is worth considering. Customers should not have to chase after the company's representative when a specific commitment has been made."

Unfortunately I am in a situation that I am now out of. I feel one main financial as a company need to reevaluate their rates and polices. It one thing if a consumer burns creditors. It&rsquo;s another when a consumer pays their bills on time. Consumers who pay their bills on time but are rebuilding credit should not be categorized in the same bracket as the ones who burn their bridges with creditors."

  "body": "This place is teetering on predatory lending. After making what I thought was my final lump sum payment, I started to get calls again months later claiming that I still have a balance. I was finally told that the balance reappeared due to having &ldquo;fees&rdquo; from a year and half ago. For some reason OMF policy is to not include fees in the final payoff. In my opinion they do this so that even if you pay your loan off they let the &ldquo;fees&rdquo; linger to have a way to charge more late fees. Today, I was told by a manager that this is &ldquo;stated in the fine print&rdquo; of the contract that they can add a new $20 charge to your account for a fee that customers don&rsquo;t even know exist. The interest rate was already too high, but after this interaction I would NOT recommend this place if you have options. They also have ****&nbsp;poor customer care. Both the rep and manager were very condescending. Beware, this doesn&rsquo;t feel like a legit lender."

After a soft pull of my credit, it was indicated that the above loan was available, so I went ahead with a hard pull of my credit to move ahead with the loan. After three days of being ignored by Representative C_ , I finally got a hold of her. She told me I was approved for a loan amount 33% lower in value and 80% higher in rate. They did not ask for any additional  information beyond what they already obtained from Credit Karma. Now my credit is worse due to a hard pull off my credit that did not have to happen. If they did not misrepresent the loan options to me before the hard pull, as has been the norm with many other companies I have worked with, I would not have authorized the hard pull.\nAlong with Cecilia, the One Main manager (E) at the ******&nbsp;CA branch was dismissive of my concerns about the misadvertising of their loans and said the company was over 100 years old, so it must be doing something right. I guess coning people in need of a loan into taking higher rate loans than necessary is good for a companies bottom line! Run as fast as you can!"

As I read it over, it said I had a previous delinquency which is a lie, Also said payment on accounts are not current which is a lie, And have new credit which is true, I got a credit card.

The representative in turn responded to tell me I owe the company two years after a payment was sent from my Federal Credit Union. Taking a loan with a bank attached to your home will have Lenders checking and verifying all of present and past accounts. The title company and the underwriter reported the $18.00 dollars. I have reports to verify this amount Where is this $4,000 amount is when they accepted a payment to close my account. Immediately the response would have been when they received the amount for the Credit Union and Mr ********&nbsp;the amount you are sending will not payoff your account.- A statement was made \"we have been trying to contact you.\" My Mother passed in 2022, the significance of this life event is my telephone number nor has my address changed to be contacted by Doctors and Nurses until her passing. No calls or Letters have been sent to my home address, after an unpleasant conversation that i was irate a newly created account was created online with a bill dated the day of today's phone call XXX XXX-**** 12:09 on September 13, 2023. That I owe $3,736.72 and the online account shows $4,724.64. I have previously accessed this account with zero $0 balance as I ensure my credit shows accurate information. Today their is a bill. I will continue to be diligent on this error of my financial history. I have alerts on my credit report - No Experian Alerts- Discover Alerts or Lending Tree Alerts have any statements or balance except the $18.00 dollars. Today September 13, 2023 this branch of one main financial added debt to my credit report. Be aware and mindful of any lending company that takes the initiative to create a bill."

I have been paying  my bill on time every month with direct debit, which works very well for me because I am a senior on a fixed income. But now, I am very disappointed with OneMain and it is very upsetting to me.\nWhen I did a loan recently, I asked the young man to set my payments so they can be directly debited from my account on the 21st of each month. He informed me that it would be no problem to do that. Now I am told, after much confusion and nonsense that I cannot have it debited on that date each month and now I am being charged exorbitant late fees each month. This is a hardship for me as a senior on a fixed income and I am disappointed that I was told the 21st would be ok when I first did the loan and not it is a problem. I am currently looking for another company to take out a loan to pay off OneMain and be done with this company once and for all. It&rsquo;s a shame because up until now, I have loved dealing with OneMain. Now everything is so messed up and it is disappointing to me. I have several people ask me to recommend a loan company and up until now, I would have gladly recommended OneMain. I will not now. I am upset about the exorbitant late fees I&rsquo;m being charged when I clearly asked the young man if my payments could come out on the 21st of each month. I will be looking forward to finding a way to pay this loan off as soon as I possibly can. I am upset and tired of seeing my account saying &ldquo;Past Due&rdquo; when I asked for a payment date to be set when I first did the loan. I am disgusted and very disappointed with the service and treatment I am receiving.\nAnnette ******"

I went from a bad deal to a better bad deal with a little money in my pocket to boot.  Everything was okay until I re-financed again at the end of last year.  Since then, it's been one thing after another.  It was a constant case of different people saying different things.  I would think everything was cleared up, then I would get yet another phone call from someone else, generally asking for more money or an additional payment, when I had been told that I had done everything I was supposed to do, made any additional payments that had been requested (and I asked SEVERAL times!), and when I tried to hold them to what had been said earlier, all I got was rude and condescending behavior.\nWhile all of this was going on, I was pouring money into the car to keep it running: brakes, constant oil changes (the engine was burning oil), and every little thing on the car was starting to fall apart.  I found out recently that the engine was highly likely to need replacing, and I made the painful decision to surrender the vehicle.  My local branch could not have been less helpful.  All they wanted to talk about was that I was still responsible for the same payments ($587 on a car that I no longer had), and would not let me surrender the car until I had committed to SOME payment or another.  The they tell me that because I came late that I might not be able to leave the car there.  They were coming to pick up the car, but since they didn't know when If I left the car there overnight and it got towed, I would be responsible for the fees.  So I left work early for NOTHING.  OMF already has $14K form me on a $17K loan, which I still miraculously owe $17K on, on a car that is only worth $5K-$6K, which they will get when they sell it at auction.  And still want me to give them another $8K to \"settle\" my loan.  This is RIDICULOUS!"

  "body": "In July OMF added collision and comprehensive insurance on my car that was used as collateral. My payment went from 516 monthly to 623 beginning in July. Unfortunately July 28 I had an accident that caused a bit over $4000. ****** *********&nbsp;company paid the insurance payment to OMF who in turn applied it to my loan amount instead of paying the body shop where the car was being repaired. When I spoke to the Manager of the OMF branch I was told it was a mistake that would take a few days to rectify and I would have the money to pay the repair shop. This was on a Friday. I followed up on the following Tuesday as the manager of the repair shop hadn&rsquo;t heard anything\nAnd was looking for payment. I have called several times to the OMF branch and have been told it&rsquo;s going to take a couple days. Call us back next Wednesday. It&rsquo;s been three weeks with this back and forth business. Playing phone tag. Trying to get this situation straightened out so I can get my vehicle back. Today I spoke to Tanya the branch manager who sounded annoyed at me for calling her back when she specifically told me to to call her back in about 15 minutes as the District manager happened to be in the office. I explained how much stress this was putting on me because I have the repair shop calling me and I have no answers for them. She said she would call me back around noon and if needed she would leave me a voice mail. Didn&rsquo;t happen. Was also told they would cut me a check in their office if need be to pay the repair shop. I&rsquo;ve been with OMF for a year and have paid my payments every month. I can&rsquo;t believe the crappy and shady way I&rsquo;ve been treated. Not satisfied with this company and will not recommend them to my worst enemy. What a shame. Hopefully tomorrow brings some answers. I am very sorry I ever did business with this company."

  "body": "I have been a long standing customer and never missed a payment. The past few months I have contacted the 800# for customer service asking questions and seeing what my options may be due a difficult situation I'm in. I only ever get transferred around to multiple people, usually on the phone for an hour or 2. So today I decided to go into my local branch, feeling confident that I could at least get some answers. Boy was I wrong! I was there about 30 minutes. Every question I asked, I was told \"we don't know\". So I would say \"so who can I talk to?\" Again, I was told \"there is no one, we don't know\". HOW could a local branch not know who I could speak with if they themselves didn't have the answer?? The guy that I mostly spoke with is the office manager, Lamont. He got irritated with me as I kept asking for some kind of answer. He finally had me call another company and she couldnt help me because it's One Main's account! So then I was really getting upset. The figures I was given weren't matching letters I received in the mail. I asked about a deferment as I was told I qualified to get one, and I am still being charged almost my full payment amount! A deferment is NOT making a payment, it's skipping a payment. When I asked about that he waved 2 pieces of paper in the air, and said you can either sign the deferment or sign a voluntary repossession and leave the car here when you go. Really!! So as I'm trying to keep my wits about me, he tells me that I had been there too long, he didn't have any answers or me, and that I needed to leave!!! ME, the person who makes my payments each month...TO PAY HIS SALARY!!! He told me to leave.... I will spread this information everywhere I possibly can! Stay away from this company at all costs!!"

I'd recommend anyone to get them because you really never know what can happen and it does add to the your monthly payment and it is very much worth it. It can be as easy as if someone passes away as when you have your loan to you passing and a beneficiary getting something to stay on their feet. If you looking for some money to help with the unexpected this is the place to go. I'll be back if I'm in need of money to help expand the growth again. I would recommend OneMain Financial to anyone who is in need of a little extra money.\nThanks for all the great things you do and all the things you Offer OneMain Financial."

A young lady by the name of Meagan assisted My Mom &amp; My husband with the approval process.  She advised my husband that they were approved &amp; that they will get a call later to go over approval terms.  Meagan looked at my husband who is African American &amp; stated that she needed to speak with someone about the loan.  She made a notation on the loan to the fact that My Husband was taking advantage on my Elderly Mom &amp; that she was not coherent to understanding what the loan was about.\nMeagan looked at my husband as a threat to My Mom &amp; not as an individual assisting his Mother in law with a loan.  My husband &amp;  I are my Mom&rsquo;s caregivers. We care for her , feed her &amp; take her to her Doctors appointments.  How dare she think that my husband was trying to take advantage of his Mother in law.\nMy husband is a licensed Prayer Minister &amp;  took my Mom to her appointment. I was at work &amp; not able to assist her. Meagan misjudged by husband by the Color of his skin.  He was in Summer attire had he dressed up in a suit would that make a difference?  Nope.  A Black Man assisting an Elderly woman is an automatic Red flag. My Mom was coherent &amp; answered all questions asked.  I assisted my Mom with follow up calls on loan status.  Every conversation with Meagan was short &amp; rude.\nI spoke with Manager Logan who informed me that it&rsquo;s in the best interest of my Mom that loan was denied even when she was advised loan was approved &amp; terms were disclosed.  Logan on last week stated he will call me once he gets an update.  Logan actually spoke with my Mom &amp; she told him that she understood the terms of the loan clearly &amp; didn&rsquo;t know why it&rsquo;s taking so long for a signature for clearance if it was approved already.  Logan said that his agents are trained to look at certain Red flags.\nOne Main fin needs more training w/ their team."

I have asked for verification of cancelling the and response to that request and was told maybe I will get it or maybe not. The email to the division to try and correct this has never been responded back to. professionalism on the phone was rude by most representatives.

The only downside is that you&rsquo;re unable to transfer the funds directly to your debit card or bank account, although the website says that you can. For a customer like myself who lacks a local bank account, leaving out of town in a few days (hence the reason for the loan) has to electronically deposit the funds into my out of town bank and wait for it to clear. Gross disadvantage! Either update the website or implement that capability."

Hadn&rsquo;t screenshot when I was online unfortunately and didn&rsquo;t get an emails with the details.\nChalk it up to a loss and wasted credit pull. I&rsquo;d recommend steering clear."

I didn't feel like just another signed paper or number, I truly felt like an individual.\nI liked that I had an actual office with real people to go into and go over and sign my paperwork with. There was no pressure to purchase the extra options, even after taking the time to review them with me multiple times.\nI would recommend OneMain Financial to anyone, especially if all of their staff provide as good of customer service as Jamie did."

I then told her I&rsquo;m sorry but she never asked. She left to do so and the  manager, Valeria ******,  intervened and said to her associate ,&rdquo;remember we can&rsquo;t do instant transfer because of that one thing on the system that changed yesterday&rdquo;. I then got into a discussion about why not if she just said it was possible if she cancels the contract. She then got aggressive and said, &ldquo; you&rsquo;re just going to have to wait&rdquo;.

It was only then, after two days of dealing with them, that I was told that a co-signer has to be either a direct relative or someone who lives in the same household. This would have been beneficial information to have been given when I was first told to get a co-signer!

  "body": "First of all they tell you they won't do a hard inquiry, but they do.  I've usually had no problems making my payments until i lost my job last year during covid.  And when i call OMF to tell them i had lost my job, they still expected me to make my monthly payments. So, I had use my savings to make sure I paid every month. I also called them to tell them i couldn't afford the monthly payment of 400 a month because i was without a job. They did help me with that, but now I have a job that doesn't pay what i made before and still can't afford the monthly payment. All they kept doing is deferring my monthly payment to a lower amount until this month. An unexpected bill came up and messed up my financial situation and i called to tell them, and they said i could no longer modify to loan payment to a lower amount. So they called and harassed me every day. Every month when i called, spoke with someone different and they tell me different things, months later, someone tells me i could have used my unemployment insurance that i pay on with this loan to cover my cost when i was without a job. I'm like, why couldn't you people tell me that when i called to tell you i lost my job.  They are very misleading. I regret getting a loan with them. I was better off just paying my credit cards off myself."

They end up wanting to put a lien on my vehicle that I own for a couple thousand bucks but my vehicle is worth much more than that. Why on earth would I want to put a car loan on a car that I own. They just want to pass me a bit of money in the hopes that they can find a way to repo a car I already paid for. Plus people usually pay off car loans so they own it and no longer have a loan on the car. Had I known this would be the case I never would have submitted. Preapproval process from them is a total scam and now I have a hard pull on my credit from this. STAY AWAY."

She essentially told me, my husband and another employee at the branch to shut up because she was on the phone. My husband approached her and informed her that she had offended us.The woman doubled down and was even more outrageous. I ended up getting up and leaving because I couldn&rsquo;t believe how Patricia was speaking to my husband. We ended up leaving and not signing the loan merely for the fact of the treatment we received from Patricia. Do not do business here unless you want to be treated like dirt."

When I told them I'd just gotten out of a **** they then proceeded to say they were sorry for my health issue but they need a payment. I told them it wasn't going to happen as I was fighting for my life. When I got healthy again I asked for the pay off amount for the next day because I was going to have to clear it with my bank first and I knew I wasn't going to be able to do it the same day. They then proceeded to tell me I had to make a payment that day. I told them I was going to completely pay it off and that they weren't going to tell me what I'm going to do. I had to ask several times for the pay out and they STILL insisted I make a payment. My question was, why would I make a payment when I'm going to pay you in full?! Doesn't make sense. These people have nasty attitudes and can't handle their own isht thrown back at them. Fast forward... I put in another application recently. I actually have money, I just wanted to see if they hold grudges. So she calls me yesterday and proceeds to ask me for information yesterday that they never asked me for. I've been working 1099 the whole time I've had loans with them and it never was a problem. Now she asks for a pay stub and I sent a read out from the company I subcontract for. \"That's not acceptable\" is what I was told. My credit and the money I make is better than it ever was before and I already know It's because they got cussed out because they wanted to be ignorant. I didn't really need the loan, it was a test and they failed miserably. If you don't pay it in lump sums you'll never pay it off. They will continue this practice and will lose in the long run because of not being professional. I've had $12,000, $5,000 loans with these folks that I've paid in full. This last application was for $2,000 and I was told I didn't qualify. So now.... Tell me if that makes sense? Lol"

I would like an explanation as towhy my interest rate is so high. I was going to try another lender but settled with one main because I needed to debt consolidate and did not want another hard inquiry on my credit report from another lender."

I went into the office on Friday and Brad said she left and to call back Monday and make an appointment to bring paperwork in for the loan.

I fell on some hard times for a while that tanked my credit and they offered me a reasonable unsecured loan to help me out, everyone was friendly, service was fast and easy and everything was fine. I've been working my credit back up, making all my payments on time, and everything is great.\nThen I get a marketing email from them saying that since I was in good standing, I was pre-approved for a larger loan, that would consolidate my current loan with them, plus leave me extra to consolidate my credit cards.\nI thought \"great! this would really help.\" So I call them up, again, quick to answer, no robots, friendly staff, she asks me if she could run my credit. I told her I'd prefer that she didn't but since I am already pre-approved for the $3,500, the hit to my credit score would be negated by the credit card debt I take care of. Then she tells me it would have to be a secured loan where I'd have to lien my car. I live in the city, I don't own a car. So then she said there's nothing she could do, they took points off my credit score I've been working hard to build back up, all from a misleading marketing email.\nShame on you, OneMain. That was a really really bad move. I'm super upset."

If I could give them zero stars, I would.\nAgain, they have run my credit without my knowledge, nor my authorization. If one has never been a customer/client of theirs why would you continue to run some ones credit if you were contacted previously about this very issue???\nYet, on 1/20/21 and again on 6-4-23 they have fraudulently pulled my credit report. Coincidentally, I was contacted by the same person located in their *********, MD offices regarding this matter. Make it make sense, please!!!\nYou would think that after notifying them in Jan. 2021 that they would have flagged, or at least notated their files about this incident. First there was a text message that came thru at 00:29 this morning 6-6-23, then followed by what I assume to be a system generated email at 00:31, followed by another email at 9:46 am, then a phone call at 9:47 am.\nI have called back no less than (7) times today only to get the branch managers voicemail each time. I've sent an email to the local branch, and not to mention my wife has called as well. Still no response as of 5:10 pm EST.\nFor a business that seems so eager to get my business, you would think someone would answer the phone, or respond to an email, right?\nFor those of you looking for a reputable banking/personal loan institution to help you with your financial needs please note that this clearly this is not one of them! After reading so many of the horrible reviews, they speak for themselves.\nDo yourself a favor and bypass this company. Your time, and effort are worth so much more!"

Utterly frustrating. Having to go back and forth day in an day out every day a \"loan specialist\" asking for different documents; why not just ask and COMMUNICATE all criteria and documents NEEDED the first day of initial meet. Very distasteful of the way and process OneMain Financial does to accept \"customers.\" Or does this have to do with the mere loss of 20milion lawsuit? I have never have such a struggling treatment when it comes to borrowing a loan."

My last payment online said I owe 237.92 and they were charging me 242.32 and are saying there is more interest that I am being charged thats why there is a difference between what i see online and what i really owe so when is this interest ever going to end when I'm in the grave?

They should not be saying words like \"refinance\" or \"auto loan\" this should be very very illegal"

I was told by a rep AND it stated on the website that applicants have 30 days from time of submission for the branch to process a loan for final decision.  My application was closed on 5/18/22&hellip;one day after I spoke to an in store rep about the additional paystub she wanted (5/17/23).  The rep assured me that she would process the loan the next day given I uploaded what she asked for.  I uploaded what was requested minutes after ending our convo.  She promised a call back the following day&hellip;no call back.  Then 5/19/23 when I call to check the status of the application, I am informed that they closed it and I would need to reapply to move forward.  I was then told they could remove the second inquiry should I choose to apply again!  I was told they did not have access to my original application&hellip;but that they stored all of my documents in their &ldquo;database&rdquo; so I didn&rsquo;t need to upload them again.  After all of this trouble, a preapproval based off of tax documents and all but ONE paystub, and TWO hard credit inquiries&hellip;I was DENIED!  How can you give me a preapproval for a secured loan of 19k&hellip;then turn around and deny me?  Sounds to me like all they wanted was my personal and very sensitive information.  Now I have to walk inside of the branch with a letter stating I contest the last hard inquiry just to have it removed.  I asked them to permanently expung my electronic data from their systems and the acting branch manager (Nicole from branch #****) basically told me it will be deleted once they process the denial letter. I then asked for proof that my information will be deleted from their systems indefinitely and she said the denial letter will be proof.  This is a complete mess and leaves me very unsettled! Their lending practices are predatory, high risk, and borderline discriminatory."

I applied for a loan with them and got approved once I got contacted by them they randomly dropped the ball on me saying they could only approve me if I put my vehicles title up for a title loan which is nothing of what I applied for and got approved for. I really needed the money as my car was In the shop and needed to get it out so I ended up putting my cars title up. When I spoke with a gentleman named Otto he asked me if I wanted my loan covered with insurances he went over them one by one I said yes to every single loan insurance offered. On 5/11/23 I get rear ended which pushed my vehicle into the car in front of me. File a claim with geico and my car is now deemed a total loss unfortunately. This is my only car and the only car I can afford. When I called OneMain to tell them of the accident they advised me I did not take the GAP Insurance. I tell them that I advised Otto I wanted all the Insurances when he offered them to me. OneMain precedes to tell me that I don&rsquo;t have GAP insurance but I have unemployment Insurance, injury and life insurance on the loan but no gap insurance. They tell me there is nothing I can do and basically I&rsquo;m screwed. I keep arguing with them that I wanted the gap insurance and I told the loan officer I wanted gap insurance. They still said they couldn&rsquo;t do anything for me. Now geico values my car at $6600 which I get nothing of that money to get a new car and I still have to pay the rest of the money owed to the loan because they failed to follow my directions when I told them I wanted gap Insurance on the loan. Now tell me who in their right mind would  be so cautious to get all other Insurances but opt out of the gap insurance on the loan? It does not make sense to me!!!! They screwed me over and showed zero remorse. Now I&rsquo;m carless have no way to get to work which is far from home and no way to see my child who lives 2 hours away from me. DO NOT TRUST THEM!!!!"

Called the evening of 7/14/2022 with the offer I selected and an appointment was made to come in the morning of\n7/15/2022 to sign the paper work. Arrived on 7/15/2022 when Karla * *********&nbsp;came out of the back office look at me stopped on the other side of the room and I was told those offers weren't\navailable to me. I was sent to a back room where I sat for 50 minutes. Came out of the back room to leave got 4 blocks away and she called and said they finished the offer for me.\nWhen I went back for the signing Karla * *********&nbsp;gives me the mouse but she uses the key board to advance to all the signing pages. I asked what are all the pages your passing she backed up 3 pages to show there was nothing important on  them. The signing took 10 minutes?  There was no consolidation of the two loans which would have saved me $300 a month and the cash payment would have helped. Instead I still had 2 loans 1 higher with payments in the middle of the month. I said people that are retired don't get paid in middle of the month I was told I couldn't get that changed. The offers came from One Main they are taking back because of what I looked like. Someone asked maybe it was your age RETIRED INCOME only thing left is my race and she's lying to Julia in the Executive Office of Customer."

  "body": "I took a loan for the amount of $3500. I paid $2000 back with one month and didn&rsquo;t owe for a year. Beginning of this year I faced a financial hardship, in which I was not able to resume payments but spoke with customer service agents to rectify. Despite speaking with them I began to receive up to four calls daily from various branches, as well as texts and mail. They also reached out to my parents despite me speaking with them. My parents were not co-signers or listed as contacts on this loan. Moreover, I resumed working and was able to make a $134 payment. I was promised that the calls would stop but the very next day they resumed up to four times a day and continue. I will never borrow from here again."

It seems like a scam to me and that I will never get this paid off by the maturity date. They ask me all the time if I want more money and the answer is no. I'm sick of them. In a year it only looks like I paid $100 of the entire loan. I pay $378.49 a month. Something doesn't seem right."

I have had issues here since signing the contract, but what happened today was so unprofessional and a waste of my time.\nLast month, I called to see if I could get more money since I didn't accept the full amount they offered me at the time I took the loan out.  I was told there is no equity built up and no money available.\nLast week, while applying for other loans, a third-party loan service sent my application to OMF and I got a call from one of the employees on 4/14 at that same branch offering a loan.  I explained that I already have a loan and was denied additional funds, but the employee insisted they could submit the loan for refinancing to the underwriters.  She said that she would call me back with an answer that day.  She did not call back. I called to follow up on 4/19 and 4/20 and no one answered, so I called the branch in *******&nbsp;for assistance. I was told that either someone from their branch or the ***** *******&nbsp;branch would call me back about the status of the refinance request.\nLater on 4/20, the person I spoke with on Friday called and said I was approved for $3100 instead of the $5000 I applied for.  We set up an appointment for me to go into the branch today  (4/21) at 2 pm to close on the loan.  I was in the area early and went in, but unbeknownst to me, the loan had actually not been approved.  The employee and the manager sent the request for the loan to underwriting while I waited, without telling me what was going on. The employee took pictures of my car and the odometer, so I thought all that needed to be done was signing.  A call came in and I then heard the manager speaking about the loan being denied.  I asked why they had me come in, the answer was the loan looked like \"a good deal\" and like it would be approved.  I'm livid!  I made arrangements thinking I was getting the loan!!!"

I clarified the non-secured loan terms several times with multiple reps. Only offered much higher interest loan for much longer term in the end. Don't let them waste your time. Their system was down multiple times throughout the loan process, or they made me wait hours to discuss with one agent. A lost cause in the end and not even any apology."

But by doing this I am eliminating other debts with higher interest, which is amazing.  I truly appreciate the young woman I dealt with, and this company.  Would recommend them to anyone."

They would take almost a week to pull payments from my account. Then they would charge me on their end as well as my bank for each time it was declined. I pulled out a 5k loan from them and ended up paying well over 10k with interest and fees. I DO NOT RECOMMEND. THEY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOUNG PEOPLE ATTEMPTING TO ESTABLISH CREDIT. I have multiple loans and i do not have any issues with any other lender. One Main caused me financial hardship for almost 5 years. I WILL NEVER USE THEM AGAIN."

I put a vehicle up for collateral the vehicle however blew the motor and was instructed to get a price from junk yard they will release the title to them. It has been over a month since anyone has attempted to call me in regards of doing anything all they call for is money and even then sometimes it's taken out in different names like a partner business. I mainly just need the junk vehicle removed already from the street in front of my house and they won't allow it to be touch. No further payments will be made until they get rid of the truck or release the title."

  "body": "On 25 Feburary I arrived at One Main with a cashier's check from my bank to pay off my loan. My Cashiers check was greater than the amount of owed.\nNow the night before I had a DIF in another state. So I requested to pay all but a small amount (less than 8%) to manage minor costs incured with any Death In Family travel.\nTo my surprise, They not only said No, but were rude and dismissive. Didn't even offer any alternative (I guess the amount remaining would not be profitable enough for them).\nFurther, the CHECK they did give me was Declined. After calling One Main and checking other places, it was finally accepted.\nOn March 5th, I filed an official grievance (verbally and in writing) with the corporate executive office. To this date I never received a response to my complaint, let alone an apology for their rudeness and mistreatment, or Any Explanation Why I Could Not Keep A Small Loan Amount Open?\nNote, In the 2 years I was with One Main, I never missed a payment, been late with a payment, or given any reason to mistreat like this.\nToday 16 March, 2023 I received a phone call from One Main. I would expect The corporate entity would perform a Cause and Correct Action exercise on my case. They did neither. This is not a company to do business with. I was again dismissed. One Main Didn't address the issue. I still don't know why I was not allowed to keep a small balance on my account!\nOne Main is not a company you want to do business with. They're like a fair weather friend. When things are good, sunny skys, they're your friend, but if a few clouds row in,  they don't know you, you're garbage."

If you really need help it's an absolute waste of time and effort on your end. They have false advertising to reign you in and then when your \"fake\" approved the terms STILL change.

  "body": "Needed a loan. I had a valid government ID my paystub.\nI applied online from my Credit Karma app. I thought it was gonna be fast. Upstart took only a few days when they gave me a loan 2 years ago and it was all online. I scanned my ID and took a screenshot of my paystub.\nThen a lady called me to verify my information. She did her job tryjng to verify me. I guess thats how it works? It was more of an interrogation. No customer service voice. I guess it's okay for them because Im the one asking for help?\nThey said I needed a printed out paystub which my company never gives, it is all online but the lady insisted that I give them a printed out copy.\nThen they want a picture of my social security card. My paystub contains the last 4 of my SSN.\nThey also needed to take a picture of my ID showing the four courners instead of the scanned version.\nI get it. They're probably a legit company and they want to verify my identity, and they just dont believe me yet. Just dont give people an online option if youre just gonna ask them to come to the office anyway.\nIf you needed more info to begin with, please ask us to upload all the things you actually needed on the online form and be specific:\n&gt; please show the outer corners of the ID\n&gt; the actual printout of the paystub is better.\n&gt; a picture of your social security card.\nOverall I can just go to another company where I dont have to feel interrogated like that."

I fell behind and each time I tried calling to resolve the problem nothing I said mattered it was their way or no way at all. you talk to someone by text and then call the office and no one has a clue as to what your talking about. They claim I didn't sign a contract that was sent to me 3 times when I screenshot the proof?!?!? a year later when I'm trying to renew my registration come to find out from the DMV they filed a \"lost title\" because they forgot to place themselves as lienholders? now I have a hold on my registration for my vehicle until that is complete. my husband calls to find out what's going on and why we weren't aware and instead gets someone on the line talking to him as if she is his mom.\nThey are the worst !!! I've worked for a loan company 10 years before and never would I treat people that way."

I did it from my phone the very day I received it.  Today they took the full payment and other bills bounced and all they can do is say, you didn't complete the link, it's your fault.  Please anyone reading this do not do business with this company.  I know lending money is a heartless business but they should follow through so they have the trust of the company you are doing business with. This company will do everything they can to take your money, as much as they can, and not care about anything else.  I'm told the manager can call you back. What good will that do? Will it prevent the insufficient fund fees that I will get? Will it pay the bills that are not going to clear? Will it unmark the negative credit that I'm going to have by now paying late on these bills?  NO!"

I took out a secured loan against my Prius for roughly $5,000 with them.  Having made $2500+ in payments, they said I still owed $4900.  When I asked Jelani ********, an employee, why that was, he stated because of late fees.  I always paid on the 2nd of the month, as agreed.  The only time I was late was my last payment (this month--2 days late when I called him.)  They will call repeatedly for no reason, and they refuse to document.  Each time they have no idea what was discussed prior with their representatives.  I asked for a lien release on the car and they agreed to the ripoff $4900, but changed this two days later to $5000, with no explanation.  So, I told ***** *****, who offered to get me out of it, to forget it, because I did not want them dealing with this totally unscrupulous not-so-good-for-America American institution.  My decision: Your car will be on a county road, and good luck with that.  WARNING: No matter what state American economics has put you in, and no matter how hungry you become, dealing with them WILL make things worse for you.  DO NOT SUCCUMB TO ANY AMERICAN INSTITUTION OR COMPANY THAT BETRAYS ITS OWN PEOPLE."

I was told it wouldn't affect my credit since they already ran it once. When I finally spoke to the manager and provided everything they asked for and more they said you are declined. I asked for more information, she said your declined I can't help you. I even asked what would my payment have been to try to understand why I was getting declined? She stated I don't have that information you are declined.  She belittled me and made me feel so upset with her tone and rudeness.

So I wake up one day to see that my account is 357 dollars overdrafted, plus the 40 dollar overdraft fee. Guess who? One main. I had removed all of my payment information from their website, so how are they still taking out money. I quickly cancelled the Pending payment, and even though the payment says cancelled, they still kept my money. I called my local one main office to tell them that I had sent them letters stating that I'm in bankruptcy and that they shouldn't be collecting money from me anymore. I was told by the rep to not do bankruptcy because it'll mess up my credit, and that I shouldn't pay my attorney, and that I should just set up a payment plan with One Main first because bankruptcy should only be a last option. That is not One Main's decision to make for me. Do not get a loan from them, because it is a hell that you will never be able to escape. With their interest rate, my 12k loan turned into a 21k loan. Now, I will be unable to get groceries, despite working 40 hours a week minimum. Thanks One Main. "

I had been paying each month on time without a problem until I found out they performed illegal activity unto me.<br/> <br/> I'm trying hard to re-establish my credit by paying as much as possible each month on my credit cards and the loan I have with OMF and they recently made my score drop by 46 points for something that I NEVER applied for/agreed to. <br/> <br/> About the week of Oct 2nd, 2022 I spoke to Georgia the manager at the ********** NJ branch who answered a question for me and she then mentioned something about if I needed more money but I never told her I did. <br/> <br/> Then after talking to her on the phone I received an email asking me to send in documents if I wanted to apply for more money and I didn't send anything because I did not want to apply for more money! I'm paying every month for the loan I have with them and it's hardly going down at all, that and also I know my credit score is too low to be approved for anything so I would never have applied for another loan. I don't need anymore loan money!!! <br/> <br/> Then on Oct 16th 2022 I receive an email that says I was not approved and they cannot give me another loan at this time. I was like \"WHAT?\" It seems that Georgia took it upon herself to apply for a loan in my name using my social security number that I NEVER AGREED TO! I sat there with my mouth dropped open not believing what I was reading.<br/> <br/> Calling OMF HQ to explain did nothing. It seems they could care less. They said I did ask for more money so I told them to show me the proof. They couldn't because there was no phone recording and of course NO written request from me do they have nor did I send in any of those documents that the email asked for. I thought this was a reputable financial corp, I guess not. And trying to take advantage of someone on a less than desirable military/workplace disability I think is really messed up!"

My local branch experience was unprofessional. I called main office to close with someone else. I go through a week of \"I will call you back\", \"the verification team hasn't signed off yet\", etc. Then during the finalization process in which my login account showed approved and ready to contact a rep, the loan was reduced and unacceptable and now going on weeks with no results and a hit on my credit report.  Now onto current loan practices. If you have a current loan, information is nowhere to be found on your account login. They use a pre-computed loan information (i.e. the loan amount you would be paying off if full term). They nearly refuse to give you your current payoff or any info on your loan, which you have to call in everytime just to get constantly asked \"why do you need your payoff amount?\" in a defensive tone.  Best to find a better lender. Avoid the predatory and non-transparent practices."

When you have trouble with one loan payment, they offer deferment  with so many clauses and fees, that your total balance sky rockets and only pennies go towards your loan balance. Worst customer service of any financial institution that I've ever dealt with. Not a scam, but definitely takes advantage of people in a bind. Worst financial decision that I've ever made. Will be paying on a minimal loan for the rest of my life. Not to mention the lean on my car that barely runs. Zero out of 5 stars if it was possible. Yeah....you got me, OneMain. ðŸ¤¨"

A week went by without another word from anyone so I called them and was told my loan officer had already left for the day and I would receive a call the next morning. It's now almost a month later and still no call. I decided to use another lender that actually wanted my business and I got that loan, with better terms I might add. This company is a scam and I would advise against ever using them. I'm sorry I had to give them one star, but there are no negative star options. I'm just glad there are still loan companies that actually want customers out there. This is not one of them. "

Again recommend by Credit Karma (me thinking they should be ok financially now) so I apply, and receive a call next day from Jayden or Jared..something like that and am told it would need to be a secured loan I said ok. Then I would need to supply my banking information, Vin number for my owned NEW car, my pay stubs, and my insurance information. Was told once I upload he will call me back next day..I had to call him. He said everything is looking good verifies a bunch more info over the phone and am told I'll call you back later today. No call so I call and it is Friday he says it's looking good but continued to ask more questions and onfirming info. Then said he would call me either later or Monday. Now Monday comes wait till 4pm and call him, he's not there. Does not call back and finally today around 11:30 I call and get him. He says so sorry I got busy lets pull up your info. Says everything is looking good..reasks the same questions for the 4th time and states all is looking good and would turn it over to the manager and call me back. Finally he calls me back to say there is bad news and unfortunately they have financial difficulties and can not offer a loan at this time. So you mean to tell me it took over a week of collecting my personal information and they just now know that are broke and can't loan money???? Such a scam. "

Today I went online and applied and a lady from this office called me with the first name R.  She informed me that they needed my pay stub, DL, W2 and bank that I get deposits in.  I provided everything put the bank statement because I get paid with a live check which is on my pay stub.  I get a call from Terry ***** with a nasty attitude at about 5:30pm asking me for bank statement and ID.  I informed her that I get a live check just like Informed her co-worker and was told that was find.

She became nasty by stating over and over we can not continue, and then stated that she had already cancelled the application and I will receive a letter explaining.  She was not understand, and she over talked me several times.  Run before they get you, I am now happy that I did not go with them.  I went to ********* Finance in ******* after I got off the phone with Terry ***** and her attitude and was approved and funded within minutes.  Do not do business with One Main Financial they will waste your time and decline you after you provide them all of your information.<br/> <br/> Recap: So OneMain Financial responded with a generic response.  They don't address any issues in my complaint.  Doing the application part I informed the agent that I did not have a checking account that I get a live check and was told that was okay.  However, after sending all of my documents they rejected my request because I did not have a checking account for direct deposit.  The did not address the managers (Terry ****** attitude towards me when I ask questions.  She just wanted off the phone to the next person she did not give a dame about my issues."

Recently, we were making a real estate transaction and to our suprise, there's a lien on the deed of the property. I have been attempting to get this loan, which was paid in full 4 years ago, discharged from the deed. The different numbers I have called all lead me to a customer service represenative that appears to be working from home and reading from a script. \"you should receive a discharge within 30 to 60 days\". This is causing delays and possibly a foreit of the transaction. Very frustrating and dissapointing. "

The pull you in with a fair 1st loan once they gain your trust, they will reel you in with a bigger loan you walk away not relizing you just signed half your monthly income to them. Sure they will work with you....that way your interest is accuring faster than you can pay it...i begged them to just come take my truck, but of course in the many years of the loan what I owe is now 3xs maybe 4 xs higher than value of my truck. I guess they are waiting for me to die then they can put a lean on my home...little do they know i was trying so hard to pay them I list my home....Now i just dont care."

When I went to trade in my paid off vehicle for a smaller vehicle,  I was told there was a lien on the vehicle for over $10k that was placed by one main. When I contacted one main, the refused to email me the so called documents that I allegedly uploaded to them. I told them to mail the documents to me and that's when I knew that they illegally secured the loan. Fortunately I was able to explain what happened to the car dealer and I was still able to trade in my old vehicle for the new one. One main lied about giving me an unsecured loan in 2020 and they illegally obtained a registration and duplicate title for the old vehicle. Beware if you use them during difficult financial times. I will never use them again. They are predatory. They were shocked when I wrote a check to payoff the balance. Stay away from One Main Financial. They are crooks."

  "body": "Horrible, horrible, horrible. After consistently making payments for years on my loan, OneMain offered me a Covid loan modification after losing my job towards the end of 2020 and reduced my payments for three months. OneMain extended me and set up new scheduled ACH payments for 2021, while cancelling scheduled payments at the old amount. Then, after accepting my new payments for 6 months, with no indication there was a problem, they cancelled the remaining ACH payments. They finally restored my ACH scheduled payments three months later, but inaccurately reported to credit bureaus the wrong scheduled payment amounts, did not credit me for payments made, and reported I missed three payments, harming my credit significantly. They refuse to review my complaint sufficiently, recognize their errors, and remove their negative reporting."

I supplied them with bank information, documents and ID etc.. Received a call saying I was qualitied for $8600. They asked that I send further documentation and did two \"Hard Pulls\" on my credit. I supplied them with my most recent tax returns-2020, bank statements for 6 months, brokerage account information etc. Then they asked that I prove that my 2021 tax return had been processed. It had been submitted to the IRS April  2022 but has still not shown as processed. I sent a duplicate to the IRS last month. The IRS has informed me they are months behind for paper returns- it can take between 6-9 months. I had proof both were sent along with TaxAct documentation.  BTW- how can a company only use process-same year returns with the IRS in the rears? I offered to get them a copy from Tax Act etc.. then I was told that I would only qualify for $3000 which included a lien on my Suburban! Waste of time.. Very high interest rates!

I had sent over, what I thought were the final documents earlier. I walk in and they put me in a office/room in the front. They tell me they will be with me in a minute. I'm in there for ten minutes and all I hear is laughing and joking around. It's only two people in the office. The young lady I had been talking with throughout the loan process comes in asking for more information, and that they have to send up for approval and underwriting. I was told it should only take a few minutes. 10-15 mins later she leaves and not saying anything to me. I sit there for a while longer, and The guy comes in talks to me and say hey I don't know how much longer it's going to be but you can leave and we can complete the rest online. I say ok and I leave. I was there for 45 mins and got nothing accomplished. Needless to say I didn't hear back from him the rest of the day. The young lady calls me the next morning to finally close out the process. She was laughing and joking around with her co-worker the first 2-3 mins of our conversation. She was laughing so much she put me on hold a couple of times. We finally got through the process and I was approved for the loan."

  "body": "I have been with One Main since they were Commercial Credit. For the first time after many loans, I decided to add the disability and unemployment insurance due to my age. Unfortunately, July 1, 2021 I had a freak accident in which I have been placed on total permanent disability through December 2022 and I am waiting to hear from SSD. Prior to my Injury, my account was always paid on time, I am very disturbed because I am using the service I paid for and One Main Solutions have not been paying my account on time and not the full payment. This is causing my once current account to be late with an unpaid balance. I also receive calls from One Main reps and was asked to pay on the loan. I am not receiving what I purchased and it feels like a scam and this added stress is not helping with my recovery. I would like to know what government agency I can report this inconsistent service and also in my opinion a breach of contract. One Main reps tell me they have no control over the disability payment and that One Main Solutions is separate. I thought I would start here. To pay extra for insurance on top of a high interest loan and to see that over the course of the year, the loan amount is not moving and the service provider not providing full service is a problem for me. In addition, I give the the doctors note and they make me fill out a form every month in order for them to pay anything. If I send the form in before the 18th of each month they pay a portion and I was told I could not send my form in until after the 18th of each month, my payment is due around the 20th. Do I report this to the BBB or FTC? I have not worked over a year and ONE MAIN SOLUTIONS failure to pay my account/disability insurance  and keep it current like it always has been is unacceptable. I am tired of fighting these people, the stress is not helping with recovery. I want all of my payments paid on time in full each month after all \"I am paying extra for the service\"."

I applied a few months back, got a call before my due date to set everything up. The trial payments were set up and the last said \"your good to go, if you want a permanent modification, just call back after the trial payment on 8/13 is processed\" I kept looking at the app, I saw the trial payments set up as planned but it was showing that I was passed due. I called the office and of course was told that the other lady never submitted the application. So now I'm late. I have mountain high debt already from my parents deaths, my credit cards had to be maxed out to pay for their body care. So when I called again, the other lady said, she didn't submit it but I'll go ahead and do that. Call back in a few days to make sure everything has been updated properly. I called back yesterday, was told my modification application was denied, because I according to my check stub, I had to have a 35% decrease to qualify! I'm furious. How is maxing out my credit cards and having to pay my mom and dads body care and my sons surgery and all that, not considered income decrease and why would the lady set me up and send me on my way making me think I was approved. This company does not have your back even through unbearable moments like what I'm going through. In these times of high stressful moments I thought I could at least breathe with a smaller loan payment. I was screwed over and now I've fallen deeper into depression because of them. "

Maybe it's the employees am not sure but something is wrong.I didn't even intend on applying for a loan. I was sitting peacefully on my couch and the mailman drops a mail and it's OneMain Financial. They soposedly are a loan company with astronomically high rates. I applied for a loan they told me I was already pre-approved for in the mail. I said why not I'm already pre-approved right. I was wrong! Then they tell me to upload all sorts of documents which I did even though they were unnecessary. I do understand KYC laws but the information they request just to complete an application is a lot considering laws governing the collection of  PII and other user identifiable Data. They asked for my ID, I uploaded, they asked for my bank statement I uploaded, they asked for proof of SSN either my SSN card or W2. It's no brained that anyone will wannwr keep their social safe especially the card. my SSN card is confidential and I have never had to upload that just reading it out is usually enough for all my previous applications, I uploaded my W2 regardless. But of course they wanted more. Kept insisting I upload a copy of my SSN card. And the tone was not funny at all but nerving and annoying So my question is if you have all you need to Identify a prospective client why they to take information that is not relevant. I don't trust my SSN like that."

In May my job ended and will not resume until August 15th as I am a teacher and do not get paid during the summer months. But since I bought the insurance I thought I would be ok. I called OneMain right away and they told me that 1) they would take me off of auto pay (which they did not) 2) I had to be in arrears in order to defer. <br/> One month later I call the insurance company after I am one day late. She tried to explain to me that part of my monthly payment would be paid by them after I apply for unemployment insurance. Again, I did not get fired so I cannot apply for unemployment insurance. She then tells me that she doesn't know what to do? I tell her neither do I and ask to cancel my insurance. The insurance amount that I paid went to my loan, $103. Fast forward to setting up the deferment. I call again. Set up the deferment and receive my letter in the mail saying that I was granted BUT I would have to pay for the deferment. WHAT?! A lot! $269. She never told me this as I would NEVER agree to this outrageous practice. <br/> Fast forward to OneMain continuing to overdraft my checking, continuing to call me. I call Brian and he says that he will refund me for the overdraft (he did not and claims to \"not see my emails\") and refund me for the deferment since they overdrew my account while I was traveling. Literally had to call my sister for gas $. The calls continue. I call back. When I ask Brian what are my options until I start my new job in August his response was \"you will be in collections by then.\" <br/> So, I have an appointment with my bank to get a home equity line of credit so I can pay back OneMain and be done with them forever."

On Tuesday they proceeded to try to direct deposit the money in my account when they discovered they had used the incorrect ss# with my name. So the person was hit with a hard inquiry on their credit report without even applying for a loan. Then they proceeded to run my credit report twice. Which gave me 2 hard inquiries.I then proceeded to supply them with my ss card and a utility bill for my identification. Mind you the loan was still good under my correct social. On Friday I spoke with a supervisor Ms. Pam who informed me I needed to provided more paperwork that should have been provided at the beginning of the process. She gave a very nasty attitude because of their mistake. I would not TRUST this company with any personal information. Very UNPROFESSIONAL â€¼ï¸"

I'm an ICU Nurse and became sick during the middle of the pandemic in 2021, had a very hard time, couldn't pay. They DID NOT work with me or help me. And to top it all off.... they still reported me negatively on all 3 credit reports.  Now, I understand I owe a debt. I understand I am fully responsible.  But, they claim they will work with you, but turn around and still give you a negative rating, which makes your financial situation worse.  This year my car was totaled by a hit-and-run driver. My loan was almost completely paid off by my insurance company, over $5,000, leaving me with a little over 3 payments to get away from this company forever.  OneMain demanded I pay my monthly payment that was due a week later. Here I was with a car that needed tons of repairs, and I needed to pay the Salvaged Title fees.  I informed them about my situation, and a few months later they sent me a form to fill out for a loan adjustment with a deadline, so, I thought great, this will help..... But, no, it doesn't help.  And reporting me to all 3 credit bureaus continues.<br/> <br/> Our country is a bad financial place right now, many people can't pay for food and gas to get to work. This company will go after you no matter what. Beware. Be Careful.<br/> <br/> I'm looking forward at seeing this company's financial future.... And I look forward to the day I pay this all off.<br/> <br/> Regretful customer,<br/> Elena ******"

After submitting my application, I received offers of $10k @ 14.99% unsecured, and $14,500 @ 14.99% secured by my vehicle or home. When I replied to an email from Sereena of the **** ******* FL office I allowed OneMain access to my Chase checking account, but when I spoke to Sereena she said no documentation had been uploaded to them by Chase and asked me to manually upload docs. After several unsuccessful attempts, I secured an email address from her, attached PDF & JPEG files of recent tax return, bank statements, SSDI award letter & driver's license and sent them to her. An hour or so later I was contacted by Steven, Branch Manager who offered two loans of approximately $9,600 @ 23.95% interest for 60 months. I declined as OneMain's rate was higher than the credit cards I sought to consolidate and payoff. BAIT & SWITCH! AVOID AT ALL COSTS!"

I recently did a pay date change and was informed my next auto payment would not come out until May 17th. May 1st my account was over drafted due to them taking funds that I did not have because I was informed my next pay date would be May 17th. I requested a refund and had to gather \"evidence\" of THEIR mistake and was told the money would be put back into my account. I called again on Monday May 9th to follow up and was told it would be back in my account in 1-2 business days. The money still did not come today, May 11th. I called to see why and was told I am receiving a CHECK, not deposit, or the refund amount. I was told the \"evidence\" I submitted was not sufficient for a deposit into my account. They NEVER informed me of this. If they had, I would have gotten whatever they needed. Now I am overdrafted on my account with no end in sight until the check comes in 10-14 business days. Leaving my bank account in the negative, affecting my history with my bank, and hindering chances of future financing because now my bank account is in the negative which normally does NOT happen with me. This company does not care about their customers. They just want to take your money and refuse to make it right when they make a mistake. I will most definitely be looking into a new company for a loan to pay off my Onemain account and not have to deal with their fraudulent ways of operating. I do NOT recommend this company. "

  "body": "While I am grateful for the secured loan my husband and I were able to obtain through this company, I am HIGHLY disappointed in their billing practices. We are on a fixed income and pay our loan payment faithfully at the beginning of each month when we receive our disability and VA pension benefits. Because we were enrolled in auto pay, we needed to call each month before the original due date to cancel the auto payment so that we would not be paying two payments per month. As a fixed income family this would be a hardship. We requested many times to have the direct pay feature turned off on our account, but to no avail. On more than one occasion we have had double payments drafted from our account and due to their ridiculous policy of refusing to refund the payment until it hard posts and we can obtain a bank statement to prove that a second payment was taken, we spend days waiting for our money to be returned. This occurred again last week and overdrew our checking account and we were charged a $35 overdraft fee due to One Main's inability to follow simple customer service related requests. Now I sit here this morning frustrated again to see that One Main Financial has taken yet ANOTHER Apayment from our checking account and has essentially stolen funds that I intended to use on a car payment this morning. I will be calling the office about this, but I know I will be met with the same garbage that I need to wait until it hard posts to my account and then supply them with the bank statement and then wait some more time for my money to be returned. Meanwhile, my credit will suffer because my car payment will be late. My advice is to AVOID this company as they do not care about their customers life circumstances. They are quick to offer you a high interest secured loan but that is where their true interest in the customer ends other than stealing their money straight out of their bank account when they've already received their payment for the month. Disgusting."

I know that when I was younger I was pretty much living off of credit and I really never plan to get injured or get hurt but when I did I kind of lost everything and it ruined my credit. I'm still pretty bad at planning for the future, but I've been able to consolidate my debt twice now using one main financial. Lmao<br/> I know I probably shouldn't laugh but in all honesty, I usually make overpayments. It helps me save on interest. I pay more than what I'm supposed to and more often than I'm supposed to. Anytime I have any extra cash it goes towards my loan. I have removed 13 bad accounts from my credit. That's not even an exaggeration. 13 bad accounts. People I owed thousands to. I used a credit report to get the contact information and I negotiated settlements myself. I was able to pay back so much debt because this company took a chance on me. I genuinely do appreciate that from the bottom of my heart. I would recommend them to absolutely anyone. The interest rate is tough but again you can avoid having to pay so much interest if you're just paying ahead. Pay as often as you can. Always read the contract no matter what it is. Always read what you're signing. Ask whatever questions you can. I have never called one main with a question and got turned away with no answer. I always get assistance when I need it. I appreciate that too because customer service matters. I see so many negative reviews for things that are pretty easily avoidable or fixable. I understand having an issue or having a complaint but if you reach out and you genuinely give people a chance I think they help you and they do the best to resolve the issue. At least that's the case in my experience. I appreciate OneMain so very much. The process is quick and easy. I did it all over the phone. They made getting help simple and clean."

As upsetting as this all was, I decided on day 3 since signing that I would cancel and was told by an \"Angela\" that I had 7 days to cancel the loan so I did. Turns out that they've put this on my credit, are sending me emails and messages that I've missed payments when I've indeed cancelled such loans and believe I've signed paperwork stating such. Today I'm informed I basically have to take the loan now and I'm furious. This company will call saying I have missed payments, twice in one day calling after already explaining the situation. This has been a complete nightmare! Do not do business with this company. "

  "body": "I went through Credit Karma to request a personal loan.  OneMain Financial came up stating my odds were outstanding to receive a loan of $1500. Unsecured with a certain payment plan listed as well as the APR charged. It stated to click to accept the offer. So I applied. They then came back with an offer of a secured loan of $11,000.00.  Which I did not apply for a secured loan nor did I want a secured loan. So they hit my credit with a hard inquiry and refuse to remove the inquiry, when the product they are offering me is not even what I applied for. It is a different type of loan. I want the hard inquiry removed off of my credit. I requested it removed when they contacted me. The gentleman from the Amarillo office stated I had to call a 1-800 # which he provided to me. I called, the representative passed me over to another representative without notifying me that someone else would be coming on the line after placing me on hold who then stated that I would have to speak to the customer complaint line.

I explain why I can't make payment on the date they have chosen It still does not matter. Refusing to work with a client is not what any business should do nor make it harder for a client to be put in a position where your car would be taken if you do not make payment as they have schedule. This has caused a great deal of stress for me and i never had to deal with a company like this. Please do your research with this company before you decide to do a title loan with them."

I made to sure pay them SOMETHING even if I couldn't afford the entire amount that month  When you log in there is a form you can fill out that says you are unable to pay the full amount this month but can going forward.  I filled that out several times in December.  In January I resumed paying the full monthly amount and have paid the full monthly amount every month since.  However, to this day I am getting several calls a day, and they even call me from different locations so the phone number shows up differently.  I do not understand why they even have that form on the site to fill out if they are just going to harass their customers with calls daily.  Even after I pay them hundreds of dollars I am getting several phone calls from them the day payment, and some calls have been back to back.  Incredibly irritating.  I understand if I didn't pay anything at all, didn't fill that form out to alert them, and just avoided paying for months on end.  But they clearly see I am paying and just had a bump in the road in December.  They are relentless.  Avoid them. "

  "body": "The ********** location is an absolute joke. Absolutely DO NOT recommend doing business with that branch, personally. Very predatory, and the loan process felt rushed and uneducated. Rushed into signing everything we weren't even sure about, when we were told we were approved for so much but then the amount was cut down drastically, we were trying to say no but felt strong armed to take out the loan. Covid hit, as well as a pregnancy and we did start to struggle a little bit, but when they would call and harass us multiple times a day, my husband would give them a date we could pay, we felt belittled and had interrogation as to why we couldn't just pay then and there. They finally called me at work during a rush, and I firmly and politely told them I cannot take personal calls at work, to which I received a verbal warning from management over. Shortly after, I was on maternity leave and got MULTIPLE messages from co-workers that people were calling and asking for me, despite my asking them not to contact my workplace. We got sick of the unprofessional attitudes and are now summoned to court over something piddly the employees were too incompetent to work with us over. Absolutely, positively, do not recommend regardless of how desperately you may need the help. I personally feel like one star is too much. Hope this helps anyone and everyone considering in the future. Thank you."

I discussed the concern with a supervisor who stated that it was company policy. We reviewed all the comments and notes that I had regarding: income,  short term disability ( due to back surgery), , photo I'd, Social security card, etc. The decision to turn down my application based on their company policy could have been avoided well before I submitted an application and had my credit pulled.

Never mind the incessant amount of junk mail from them that shows up offering and trying to persuade me to take out more money.

MADE ON TIME PAYMENTS EVERY MONTH. THEN IT WAS BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION I COULD REFINANCE MY AUTO LOAN AND GET AN ADDITIONAL $1500 ON MY REGULAR LOAN. I WAS TOLD THIS WOULD LOWER MY MONTHLY CAR PAYMENTS AND MY INTREST. I WAS TOLD THIS WOULD BE AN AUTO REFINANCE. OK COOL. COME TO FIND OUT WHEN I WENT TO TRY TO TRADE MY VEHICLE IN I COULDN'T. THE MANAGER AT THE DEALERSHIP WAS CONFUSED WHY MY LOAN WAS FOR SO MUCH. INSTEAD OF DOING AS AN AUTO REFINANCE, THEY DID IT AS A PERSONAL LOAN FOR A LITTLE OVER $16,000! I HAVE RECENTLY HIT A FINANCIAL HARDSHIP AND I REACHED OUT TO THEM AND EXPLAINED THE SITUATION. THEY TOLD ME IT IS ON ME TO SELL THE CAR TO GET A CLEAR TITLE AND I AM STILL RESPONSIBLE FOR THE LOAN. I KEEP GETTING THE RUN AROUND, PEOPLE KEEP TELLING ME THEY WILL CALL ME BACK AND NEVER DO. I WANT TO GET THIS RESOLVED BUT THEY ARE NOT WILLING TO HELP AT ALL!  WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN THEY ARE GIVING YOU THE RUN AROUND AND NOT CALLING YOU? IT'S CRAZY BECAUSE I REALLY NEED THE HELP AND WANT TO GET THIS RESOLVED! BUT YET HERE I AM. PLEASE NEVER EVER GO WITH THJIS COMPANY FOR ANYTHING!"

The loan would have been $9000. Our credit is good, and they decided to give us an interest rate of 20% over 42 months. She told us our payments would be $310-$390/month (or somewhere around those numbers). This is completely absurd. <br/> <br/> They are preying on desperate people during these times when people need more fuel efficient cars to work. If you look up the average APR on a used car for somebody with good credit, it comes out between 9-15% at the worst. People with the worst credit would get like 17%. So we're getting an interest rate WORSE than people with BAD credit. Not sure what kind of backwards company this is, but I recommend never getting a loan from them if you know what's best for your financial well-being."

I tried calling several numbers and no help at all - no one knows if there is anyway to fix this in your system.    I called my local branch back to be told by Laura - that well we can't help you - guess you are banned for life from here - try getting a loan somewhere else.   Wow!!      So one main doesn't give people second chances or understands that people can change for the better.     I only applied there as it was recommended to us.

On 12/27/21 I was approved for a $6000 loan but I only accepted $1500(I didn't want to get in over my head). My first payment for this loan was going to be due on 2/1/22 in the amount of $72.79. However, on 1/14/22 I decided I needed a little bit more cash so I decided to call and see if I could get an additional $2500 added to my original loan. They said sure, it wouldn't be a problem. All we would need to do is refinance the loan. But before they could start the refinance, I would have to make the first payment to the current loan (even though it wasn't due until 2/1/22. Keep in mind it's only 1/14/22). They let me know once the Feb payment is made, the refinance will be approved and my  new payment amount of $147.04 would be due in March since Feb would be considered PAID. That seemed fair to me so I made the Payment of $72.79 on 1/14/22 to cover FEB. and they started the refinance for me right then. Here's where the problem starts. Feb 15th rolls around and my bank account was hit again for the new amount of $147.04. I immediately called because I was told the first payment on the newly refinanced loan wouldn't be due until MARCH since I had already paid the Feb payment. I finally spoke to an agent and they said well your contract says your refinanced payment is due Feb 15th. I tried to explain to them that is NOT what I was told when doing the refinance and I had already made the Feb payment EARLY on 1/14. So why would I have another Full payment due in FEB.? They insisted on just going with what the contract stated and took NO accountability that an agent gave me false information verbally . I asked for a manager to see if they could listen to the recording and the manager said it's above her pay rate and to reach out to corporate.  Now I'm here. This is a VERY DECEPTIVE COMPANY.

I thought since I only wanted like 3000 their terms were ridiculous. But anyway my credit improved and they contacted me about a loan. I came in and they offered me 2500 unsecured. If I used my new car as collateral they would loan me more. I took the 2500. A few months after establishing a payment history them they offered me more money unsecured. I redid the loan with more money now I'm back on track and can easily repay what I borrowed."

In 2015, I took out a $2000 loan nothing too much but when I was almost done paying they offered more  in 2018 which just an additional $1500 okay no big deal. Ummm bad deal, never missed a payment and somehow I'm and somehow in 2022 my overall pay back is $16,000. That's a cost of an car. They are a fraud and I wouldn't definitely recommend them to anyone!! They are rude and not helpful at all. Oh not to mention, when I requested my original contract and the second one, I ended up getting 4 different contracts. This means that One main refinanced my loan without my knowledge to get more money because there's no way I owe $16000 on a $3500 dollar loan. Oh yeah I know because I later found out the percentage was 35%. Highway robbery and a scam!!!! I hate this company!! I will never ever deal with them again or recommend them. People will never get out of debt dealing with this company. The only way people will not have to deal with them is to take a hit on your credit because there's no other way out with them."

I can only see back through Dec. 2020. But last year alone I paid them a total of $3,094.92 with only $325.14 going towards my principle. This is highway robbery. Yes, I did make late payments, but still. That is ridiculous. I feel like I am being taking advantage of completely. They call you multiple times a day from different numbers and won't stop unless you make a promise to pay.  I moved from VA to SC in May 2021 and back from SC to VA in October 2021 and all they did was offer me to move payments to the back of my loan. Not to mention the fact we are in a pandemic, they have not made any effort to help me pay off this loan down. They of course have me at the highest interest they offer 35%. Here I am 26 months into my loan and I still owe them $7,800. I called them yesterday 1.19.22 expressing myself and to see if there is anything I can do and they offer me to refinance for the first time in the 2+ years I have been working with them. They prey on the unfortunate and I promise you will end up worst off taking a loan from them. Figure out another way. "

We call to figure out next steps and they say we actually only were approved for$9,200. Okay not what we wanted but still it's whatever, we NEEDED it. Mind you at this point my income and identity has already been verified okay. I call back later the same day with different questions since no one discussed the interest rate or anything with us and Steve tells us he can try speaking to a manager to get us the full 11,000 but we would have to run our credit again so now we're confused because we had already been told we couldn't do this unsecured. He then (extremely extremely condescendingly) explains the loan process. Again we needed the money so at this point it is what it is. He then explains the final verification and says as long as we're honest about the information we ALREADY provided we would have the $9,200. So we're beginning the closing process and were toldIt'll take like an hour. Great it's a Thursday we'll have it before the weekend it was perfect. 2pm on Friday haven't heard anything so we call and a woman says oh you've been working with Lindsey and \"um let me get her for you after taking a look you will want to speak to her\". Ok so now we're furious because we know something is wrong. After reviewing THE EXACT SAME CHECK STUBS I initially provided they tell me there was an $800 discrepancy with my annual income....$800. Due to this the loan could only be approved for $5000 with a payment $100 more than the $9,200. After I vented, Lindsey tells me she already pushed for us to get more. Even though she never reached out to tell us what was going on or anything and ALSO no one ran my credit report. So what information were they even going off on? I signed authorizations provided my check stubs and drivers license and no one ever checked my credit but we were \"GUARANTEED $9200 AS LONG AS WE PROVIDED ACCURATE INFORMATION \" horrid company absolutely  HORRIBLE. You do not ever ever ever promise a struggling family money period. And if you do you need to make the call own up to the fact that you jumped the gun and APOLOGIZE. "

Never once from the beginning of the loan to the signing was I told some of the money was going to be used to pay of my existing loan. I was very specific on what I needed to use the money for and what I needed to pay off. So to get 9500 less than I was expecting was quit a shock. I called in the next day and they lady apologized and I requested to speak to the manager, she stated she was out until Monday and would have her call. I never heard anything, I was told I have 7 days to return the money to cancel it but with the holiday and the fact I bank with usaa and they need a cashiers check it's a little difficult. Very disappointed "

  "body": "**** ****** NC<br/> <br/> My husband applied for a loan to consolidate debt. He was approved for 11,000. He visited the local office and then they said the loan was actually for 9,500. He decided to still accept it. He filled out all the necessary paperwork and submitted all required documents. He went in for his closing appointment and that's when he ended up dealing with a completely different person who told him that his debt to income ratio was not ideal for the loan. He had by this point missed so much work that of course his debt to income ratio was going to be d up. They told him they'd leave the application open for 30 days. He could come back with a pay stubs that reflected his upcoming raise and has all of his hours and they'd be able to close. The same lady \"Kelly\" called him to confirm he was still getting the loan. She informed him that she would renew his application AFTER being told by HER his app would stay open for 30 days. It had only been 2 weeks. When received the pay stub for the following pay period, they told him he had to reapply. Frustrated,  he did and he was denied because his credit had dropped since he first came in and of course, they were the first company that comes up when he viewed his credit. This company is predatory. They lie to get you to apply and come in because at the end of the day, whether you get a loan or not, they get paid. My husband dealt with 4 different people throughout this process but Kelly was the most involved. Heather the manager got him in the door and the ***** dipped out. The problem is that he was told that this would not be on his credit but it's on his and mine now and we haven't received a single penny from them. They need to remove themselves to resolve the problem.  We will NEVER do business with this company again!"

  "body": "My loan officer, and the people in the branch office were great. Friendly, efficient, and responsive. Their computer systems, not so much, and that's kinda scary. With my loan approval, I was supposed to receive, pre-approved off the loan app, with no additional inquiries, an unsecured Briteway+ Mastercard.   And indeed, during the loan closing in the office (all done on touch screen), I was presented with the offer indicating same; but every time I tapped to accept it, the process crashed, generating an error indicating a \"problem on their end,\" and advising to try again later. We tried it repeatedly, on several subsequent days, with the same problem. Aggravating and a HUGE waste of time.  My loan officer in the branch spent hours on the phone with tech support in different parts of the company, and I know she cared and tried, because she asked me all the right questions about it, and for and understood all the screen prints, for her to forward on... producing no success, resolution, or even explanation.   So I just patiently waited another week to see if the system might work it all out, but never got any follow up. And when I sent an email after that to their central customer service, with all the details and screen prints of the problem, well organized and explained, I was just ignored and received no response - even after waiting yet, another week.   Getting the unsecured card along with my loan, to help build upon my good, but thin credit, was a major selling point for going with OneMain. ANY time a financial institution doesn't make good on its word, on the smallest of things, it's a red flag. This isn't a pizza that's 30 minutes late or widgets with slight imperfection they're dealing in - it's your money, your assets, and your credit, all in their hands.   But when it's NOT even in their hands, when the root of the problem isn't just human error, which we all have to be prepared to accept will happen from time to time in a one-off fashion, but rather, the problem is systemic, as part of  a flawed computer system, the red flag becomes a nuclear meltdown and cause to brace for impact on what it's going to screw up next. The only thing that could be worse, is to have it happen, with no human around that knows how or even cares to fix it.  And that's what happened next. Especially unsatisfactory given the kind of money they're making off of me, for a small and secured loan - which throws up a red flag on their customer service, to match the one on their competency at the corporate level.

In 2021 how is this company able to function without usable website? The online ports is absolute trash. Need to change anything on your account? You might as well call your local branch because the online portal lets you implement certain things but once you do. Better hope you did it right. Can't go back unless you call them and have THEM change it. <br/> <br/> Want a pay off quote?  Let's get that for you after you put in the request it by calling your local branch.  \"Pay off isn't available online\" You better keep track of that yourself if you want to know your remaining balance.<br/> <br/> Worried about fees? Guess what. Everything has a penalty fee attached. Something messed up at your bank and your direct pay gets returned? that's $25 for the return payment and a late payment penalty put on your account because it took them 2 weeks to let you know the payment wasn't going through. btw, you want to pay your penalties? Better call your local branch because you can't do that online.<br/> <br/> When the first thing they ask you is about a referral code and how to earn extra money by referring others to them. Just walk away. Just look at the 2/5 stars on BBB. There is a reason this company has that rating. <br/> <br/> For the love of God, if you go against everything this site tell you about them and get a loan with OneMain, buy their credit insurance for your loan. If you have anything happen and cant pay for your loan. You might as well sell yourself into slavery with the APR and fees. Also, they will harass you until you pay.<br/> <br/> If you're worried about your user data being handed out so you get constant calls and junk mail. This company sells your data to the highest bidder. <br/> <br/> Why even have an online website if you have to contact your local branch 90% of the time for anything you do? Just you watch, they will leave a response saying to email them or contact them via phone with your issue. Support is absolutely terrible. <br/> <br/> Out of all the other companies myself and my business have used. This one is by far the worst."

  "body": "2 months ago, i called one main financial to inquire about a loan and the young lady on the phone talked to me about getting my car refinanced. I advised to the young lady that i had a car, but it was not in my name. I explained to the lady that the car was in my father's name and we had a loan with 53rd bank. The young lady told me that none of that matter and i can come in to get the car refinanced in my name! I did and had to sign all of these documents and get a temporary payoff on the vehicle. With my father being the complete owner of the vehicle, we were told that my father would have to come in and sign over the vehicle to have it placed in my name... Everything was okay until 53rd bank began to call my dad asking him to pay on the vehicle and we then learned that the vehicle was not payed off as guaranteed by contact! I called the manager several times at the *** North location in ******* Mississippi multiple times and left multiple messages! I would always get the same thing, that some one would call me back but the never did. 3 weeks ago i was told by 53rd bank that they were going to repo my vehicle because one main financial never paid off the vehicle and i had a balance owed. After fussing and cursing i finally spoke with a supervisor named saqueita who let me know that the loan was done incorrectly and i should have never been able to get a loan as the vehicle was never in my name. This supervisor promised several times that she would fix the problem and pay the remainder balance off! She lied to me several times advising that she would call me back but never did. She promised to pay the remainder balance off again but did not! On today i received a letter from 53rd bank advising that they would be repossessing the vehicle for the remainder amount! I spoke with a young lady name keyoshia who was very rude and lied to me! Might i had that keyoshia told me that she was going to hang up on me and didn't give a **** about the loan I have! I have now obtained a attorney for illegal contracts and emotional stress!! It is crazy how you can beg a company to help you and nobody can."

The One Main bill only shows you the total monthly payment, and breaks it down into principal and interest. It shows the new balance, but I don't see the amount allocated to the insurance payment. Are we to assume that it is taken from the principal part of the bill? So that what you are paying in principal is actually even less than the tiny bit that goes to it?"

  "body": "OneMain Financial overall was helpful in providing a loan, but was not truthful about the minimum amount that I could borrow.  I only needed around $5,000, but the Loan Specialist indicated the minimum amount had to be $10,000 or more, of which I moved forward with, but at a very high interest rate and long-time payment schedule (60 months). I was not aware of available lower amounts until I viewed the actual OneMain Financial website that  includes various loan amounts and timeframes to pay back.  Also, the copy of my Loan Agreement and Disclosure Statement reads different than what is in the office.  Beware!  Do not sway from your initial intent, or move on if the entity cannot provide the terms you need.  Unfortunately, now I am stuck with a loan higher than what I needed and for a longer period to pay back because I did not follow my instincts to stick to a lower amount and payment timeframe."

I'm self employed and as a musician I get paid in cash or check. They wouldn't accept any checks I received from business accounts for services rendered THIS WEEK as proof of income. they needed tax return info from 2020. Well I could perform most of 2020, so I was on unemployment, because there were no gigs. I asked what I could do and the lady shamed me and said \"well I worked over pandemic and so did many other people so I don't see how that's relevant\".  I said, \"I'm just trying to ask questions..\", I asked if my savings totalling around $18,000 would count towards collateral towards doing what I wanted, and again she said you need to have worked and provide proof of income.  They treated me horribly and shamefully and it was rather unkind to criticize whether I was able to work while people were dying all over my industry. Clubs I used to play at never will open again... Now I'm making more money than ever and I provide proof, and am treated like trash.  Do not be surprised when a group of people wish to take advantage of a system that takes advantage of them and treats them like garbage when they need something simple. I did everything right, I paid my taxes, I pay good rent, good credit score.   At this point the gov and the financial institutions have made it clear we're on our own. Regardless of whether we did it right and provided proof of income... It's not proof unless they feel it's proof despite the contrary."

Jumped through the hoops with legal docs, finances, etc, even had appropriate collateral.  They even took pics of collateral!    Said we were a go for the amount requested.  Started filling out their forms and changing legal docs, etc, and then suddenly we saw we were only getting a fraction of what we had requested and told we could get.  Told them that wasn't right.  Our agent who helped us was wonderful and was definitely taken back by sudden change of $$ amounts.  Agent verified with someone what was requested and suddenly offered and was told \"this is all they were ever going to get\".  Agent turned to us and said this was all we were ok'd for.  Did they figure we were willing to settle after all the effort we put forth?  Did they assume we were desperate and take what they offered?  We gathered our paperwork and walked out.  We had successful loans with them in the past hence our reason to go there first.  Never again!  Where are the stars for negative!  "

It was when I started paying off the loan ahead of schedule that the customer service went south. Then I looked on the home page and it said I did not have an upcoming payment on the 4th because I had made a large payment (18x the amount due on the 4th) on the 2nd. But, voila, they deduct the regular monthly payment as if I had not made a payment. And on top of that I reduced my loan amount by 84% and they continue to charge me interest as if I never made this payment. I plan to look into the legality of this behavior, I just cannot believe this is fair or legal."

Applied for a loan, submitted paystubs and requested documentation and was told the loan was approved and we would close by end of day. Then suddenly I was told the underwriter had a question on my paystub. The formatting looked weird because one of the deduction line items fed into a second line. No big deal right? I provided 4 months of paystubs AND bank statements to prove everything added up and checked out. Then they wanted a copy of my social security card. Nothing was ever enough because some moron couldn't add and subtract to verify the amounts checked out. ALL BECAUSE OF A LINE ITEM looking strange. Any reasonable, semi educated person could have seen it was legit. As soon as the deduction total went into the hundreds there wasn't enough room in the box on the paystubs and caused it to push into a second line. Adding the deductions from all previous stubs was EXTREMELY clear. These people are the absolute worst to deal with and I would deter anyone from dealing with them. The amount of proof they requested was totally unreasonable. I took my business elsewhere and received better loan terms and a much easier process."

I applied Aug 20th, my app was submitted with screenshots clearly showing my social security number and it was approved. Days go by, never heard anything, sent several emails. Finally I called and spoke with someone who said my representative was out to lunch and he verified my application, asking questions that directly correlated with my credit history ( telling me he has the correct SS #).   He tells me my rep will call back, never heard from her.  I called again and she's busy but the rep says it's all good they just need another recent paystub.  Took care of that .  Rep finally called and scheduled an appt.,wherein I asked it be quick because that time was a big inconvenience for me.  I go in there (10 DAYS) after first applying, and they say I entered the wrong SS # and app was denied.  First of all, google has my ss# pre-filled for when I fill out apps and I highly doubt I entered it wrong, also the fact the other rep brought up my correct history, not time to mention they received several documents with correct number.  And even if it were true, it takes them 10 data to figure it out, and NOBODY calls me the day of my appt.., so I inonveniently drive 40 min to the office after having already made financial plans with promise of their loan, and I get dealt this hand.  A simple phone call BEFORE my appt would have been nice.  "

Had a remainder of around $2100 and still had around 2 1/2 years left on loan. Payments made after went to almost all interest. I didn't really have a problem with that. My problem was that I checked out my credit report and it showed I was 30 days late in August 2021. I tried to talk to small branch about this and they had me contact the main branch. I did this and they basically stated there was nothing they could do about my account.  They did not do any good faith errors.  As soon as I found out it was supposedly late I paid the account in full. I had never been late before on this or any other accounts on my credit report!! Plus think about this, payments were ~ 550/month and I still had 2 years left. My payoff was ~ $1400 which I paid off.  And they are saying I am 30 days behind. Right!! That would be a balance of over $13,000 owed not $1400.  Would never recommend this company to anyone. Sometimes you have to do the right thing as a company and look at each situation individually. But that didn't happen, there was no communication on your part. "

I was okay with that. He got the \"loan ready\" told me to pay 208 up front then my payments would be $111.00/mo. I get a email when my first payment is due & my interest rate is 35%. I would of NEVER taken out a loan for that much interest. I am so mad & I will get legal help on this. They are very deceiving. Do not even get a loan through them."

When I needed help to pay divorce attorneys, One Main was there alright, at 35%, YES 35%, interest, minimum. And a lien on a motorcycle. When I was forced into Chapter 13 due precisely to One Main and those like them, they refused to repossess the motorcycle. My attorney tells me in no uncertain terms this is their game to try and get you to make a mistake while using the vehicle, then they pounce for maximum profit no matter how they have to 'bend' the bankruptcy laws."

I was told to submit a claim and get medical, employee and self paperwork turned in. Claim was , approved, then denied and then denied again, so ONEMAIN said since I purchased the insurance that all that money would be directed to my account/ loan which I am ok with. But I feel that this was all very suspicious activity, upon finding out that ONEMAIN is associated/affiliated, owned by ******* ******* Inc(my employer).. Also I was told I would no longer be able to purchase insurance for these loans. I feel that this was very suspicious as well as unfair."

After filling out the application i was sent an email stating i was approved for $10,000 at 16% interest, pending verification of my income and identity. So I submitted both of those things. Next day a woman calls asking for more verfication, so i give it to her. She says she'll call back by end of business day, never calls. Calls me 3 days later asking why i never submitted my verification, to which i told her i had done that before i ever even spoke with her. She confirmed this and apologized. Then again told me shed call me by the end of the day. Just got off the phone with her and she had \"great news!\". She got me approved for 4,000 dollars at 18% interest. Not even CLOSE to what i was originally \"approved\" for. All this company did was waste my time, and put a hard inquiry on my credit. Thank OneMain. Wont be sending anyone your way forsure."

She said she would send text today to close. Never received text. Called Misty back, Quintin answers and say Misty is on lunch towards the end of the day. I said ok, left a message. Never received a call. So I called back again, asked for Misty; Quintin states she's busy and can't talk right now. At this point I'm feeling like she didn't want to speak with me. I know the process for loan approval. So I drive to local branch on Telephone Rd. As I waited until she closed with another party. I was then told she was too busy closing on the phone. I have to make an appointment. I drove to your branch, what you suggested I do if I can't close over the phone. I get there and I was turned away, to close 3 days later. Unacceptable!! This is by far the most rude and unprofessional company I have ever dealt with. Someone else needs to get my file and close! "

They also fail to tell you that every time you ask for a different amount or even have the slightest change on your application from income to spelling of your name they have to start all over resulting in ANOTHER CREDIT CHECK. When you share with them that you need the funds for an emergency, as in today, they take their time with call backs. That's a big IF they call you back at all.

I understood why I only qualified for 1500. I did not read the fine print online. That is my only complaint.   When I went into the office to sign the paperwork the rep was awesome.

  "body": "On or near January 22, 2020 I called OneMain to inquire about getting a lower monthly payment on a current loan in good standing with OneMain Financial.  I recall a fairly pleasant conversation with a representative named Roosevelt.  He had a distinctly pleasant disposition and displayed professionalism, yet I believe that some of the things he communicated could have been clearer and/or more precise.  I specifically asked about having my current loan refinanced after having been a loan holder for a few months.  I recall him saying something like, 'we can take look at that,' or \"let's see what I can do to get that going for you.\"  His words inferred something other than what I now understand the current practice to be.  Incidentally, I was offered another loan, with a cash payment and a similar payment to what I already had.  I did not want more money.  I wanted a lower payment but it was not explained that he was processing a new loan.  At the end of the conversation, he told me that the local branch would follow up.  I was not aware initially that I was not communicating directly with some locally given that I'd dialed the local number.  <br/> <br/> When I talked to someone from the local branch the next day, I was told that processing a new loan application involved a hard credit inquiry.  That was different from what I called for.  Had it been explained like that initially, I would have declined due to not wanting another hard inquiry by OneMain.  <br/> <br/> My issue is that I was not told that there would be a hard credit inquiry.  I thought they could somehow lower my interest rate or refinance without another hard credit inquiry.  I'd been receiving offers suggestion that I was pre-approved for a new loan.  I did not want an expanded or new loan, or a higher payment, or very similar payment to what I already had.  Another concern is that I was told by a couple of people at the local branch that I could submit my request in writing and that they would submit it for consideration.  I submitted a written request on at least two different occasions and no one has responded.  I believe that the process was not clearly explained, I am disputing consenting to a hard inquiry which has adversely affected my credit scores.  I do not want to make any specific negative allegations but I do know that I would have declined at the time had I known.  I am asking for special consideration be given to my circumstance and that the hard inquiry be revoked and/or that I be allowed to successfully dispute through my credit monitoring product. And, I'd like for someone to follow up with me about this situation and my request rather than have been ignored."

When I called and asked why wasn't money returned to us, they advised it was their policy! Really?

I dont know if theyre selling information, discriminating or what- but like many black folks in this thread ive experienced the same issues of shady situations. I applied for a 4000 loan was preapproved for it and was made to jump through hoop after hoop over the course of a week. I had to furnish proof of income, proof of residence, and id- got that done and documents sat in so called review for 5 days...calling the office multiple times a day- n oone EVER picked up the phone. To get them to actually call me back i had to have someone from the main branch call someone in the local branch. After i FINALLY got through the lady says to me \"ill be honest doesnt look like youre gonna qualify because on your credit you have a 100 dollar bill with geico\" so she says theyll use my car as collateral i said ok- now she takes issue with whether or not my car is actually paid off (see the trend here...if any of my caucasian brothers and sisters experienced this please speak up because it is looking suspicious) So she calls the bank for my car loan and they confirm that the car was, indeed paid in full and they fax over proof...so now she says shes uploading the application to higher up and she'll call me back. 10 minutes later i get a call saying NOW we want proof that youre actually employed...HUH???!!!my pay stubs arent proof that im employed so that verification meant nothing and besides that youre sitting in my face calling me a liar or a fraud or both for a 4k loan that you intend on charging me 10.8k for over the life of the loan????? So i have to now endure this disrespect. Now im reading alot of these posts and the ones saying what im saying seem to mostly (maybe not all but mostly) of African American descent: there definitely seems to be some racist or classism at play in their decision making. I would add that my bank loan rate for 2k is 50 bucks a month for 48 months. Also my credit is a 714...and im Black as black can get. I will never do business with them and i would advise anyone else thinking of doing business with them to find an alternative- these people are unprofessional, disrespectful crooks. Period."

  "body": "Up until this morning I would have given OMF a 5 star review. I have been a customer since 2015 and they have always been helpful and accommodating.<br/> <br/> I have a loan with them which is secured by my car. As I said, I have been with them for a few years. My latest loan is a refi from my last one and I hit the 12 month mark today. No missed payments, paid by the due date, each and every month. <br/> <br/> I few months ago, my car started to go wrong, slipping gears, overheating, battery draining flat, etc. Then a couple of weeks a go it started developing an electrical problem and now we know why. Every time I turn a corner water is pouring into the inside of the car from the AC unit all over the electricals and creating a nice little lake in the footwell. <br/> <br/> I took the car to the mechanic again and was told emphatically that it should be parked immediately, it is too dangerous to drive and and the cost to repair is in the thousands. This car is about to hit 190,000 miles, would be worth $1,500 in great condition and is 13 years old.<br/> <br/> I clearly need to get myself a new car, but this is where the issue is - the lien on the car. The mechanic made it clear he wouldn't even give me $100 to take it off my hands and doesn't know anybody that would touch it. <br/> <br/> So I call my ONF branch. The guy I speak to, doesn't listen to a word I am telling him and says if I can get maybe $2,500 for it they can refi the loan. As I noted above it is worth $1,500 in good condition. I make it clear, I want to keep paying the loan, I don't want to refi, I just want to be able to get rid of the car, even if it means junking it and that I might as well park it in front of their branch and give them the key. We are getting nowhere so he transfers me to the Manager.<br/> <br/> Straight away the Manager is aggressive and says 'what are you expecting from me, we are going around in circles here and I have other customers'. Not a great start.<br/> <br/> So I ask him what it will take to be able to remove the lien from the car so I can get rid of it, he barks back without missing a beat, $7,500, So now we've gone up $5,000. Great. Then he tells me (very irritated) if I can give them a few thousand they can refi the loan. I don't want to do that,(I need to buy a new car obviously) and I am 12 months into a 5 year refi. If I refi again its going to be another 5 years and I'm never going to be free of this loan. So I say, sounds like my only option is to park this car on my drive and let it rot for 4 years. He replies 'Yep'.<br/> <br/> Thanks a lot OMF, I feel like a really valued customer. You've taken me from a very happy customer for 6 years, completely current with no missed payments,  to a very upset one, who is completely stuck in an impossible situation in less than 10 minutes.<br/> <br/> That's where loyalty gets you with OMF.<br/> <br/> Jeremy<br/> ******** NC"

When I reached out to them today I was told my application time out, and they were now declining my application. They had me jumping through hopes for a month, and not one person that I spoke with ever made me aware my application was in jeopardy of timing out. To add insult to injury they ran my credit twice decreasing my score by 7 points. I've never left a bad review before but having someone take a month of my time, and not even give the consideration to call me to state my application was timing out, or they changed their decision was very unprofessional. And very upsetting I can't get my time back, or my 7 points back to my credit score. "

  "body": "If i could give negative stars i would give them negative 5 stars. I got a personal loan from one main in october of 2019 for 8700 to pay for airfare to mine and my husbands wedding in Guam. I've been paying on this loan for almost 2 years and you know how much i still owe on it ?? Also i pay over 300 a month. I still owe 8300!!! How is this even possible so only a couple dollars a month is going to the principal. If my husband and i were better informed and not rushed through signing we would never have agreed to this loan. By the time we pay pay back this loan we will have paid over $18,000 for an $8700 loan how can this even be legal. So now my husband and i start our marriage out with a nice big debt and this loan has already caused problems for us. I need to find a way to get a loan from someone else and pay off this one. I will make sure everyone i know or ever meet to never use one main financial this us the worst banking institution i have ever using in my 19 years of banking."

I did get a loan from them however two of the vendors claimed that the checks I used to pay my account weren't valid and they were returned to One Main as unable to process. This has caused extreme harm to my credit. The first vendor issue was resolved after One Main ensuring that the vendor took the money and processed the money. After months of being passed around, One Main finally admitted that the check wasn't cashed and another check was reissued after 3 months. 2 years later, I found out that another vendor also never accepted the check provided by One Main, closed my account, and has this bill on my credit for now 2 years. During this 2 years I've been paying One Main for this bill and they have never notified me of the issue. I've been trying to continue with my efforts to fix my credit from being exhausted from medical bills and discovered that another vendor that I paid off from One Main is claiming that the check wasn't valid. I am currently going through the same run around that I went through 2 years ago. I've been trying to get this issue resolved for 3 weeks and I keep getting told that there are no available managers and to keep calling back. I'm desperate for help and this situation is making me feel physically sick. "

Below is the complaint summary:   \tReceived unsolicited mail from One Main Financial saying I was pre-approved for a loan, Went to www site specified which stated in two places that entering data would not affect my credit score. There was no place on the form which stated interest rare range or fees for load initiation, etc. I filled out the required data and received an email and txt stating to call a number to go over the loan details. It was at that time I saw a \"hard credit pull\" on my credit report. AFTER the hard pull is when the interest rates (13-39% plus 150 loan initiation fee and 88 dollar processing fee) was explained. I complained and was given case number being told someone from corporate would contact me later that day or next day but they would put me on the \"Do not solicit\" list. I have been receiving daily contacts since (from the 10th - 15th) I waited 3 days and called back leaving a msg. Forest contacted me back on 6/15. stating the www page does provide info stating the \"hard credit check\". I asked him to \"print screen\" where that was or walk me thru it. I went online again while he waited and no where did I see their system state a hard credit would occur. He refused to provide the asked for information or provide the recording of the call (even though early on the call, he stated the call would be recorded). If feel this lending practice is unethical and not in compliance with \"Truth in Lending Act of 1968\" I have asked for the hard credit check to be reversed which the company refused to do. "

I have had no issues with my loan, the representatives have always been nice and helpful, and there has never been any pressure to purchase the \"extras\" One Main has to offer. Compared to other reviews, I have to assume that my excellent experience has to be the area I live in and the individuals I interacted with. I will continue to use One Main as long as this experience continues."

  "body": "5 years ago, I applied for a loan through One Main Financial in **** Georgia. The people there were nice and understanding because I had wanted to consolidate my debt. It helped at the time and I continued to pay my loan monthly. I was never late. I was always on time. <br/> <br/> Then the **** office transferred me to their ****** GA office and that's when things started to turn for the worst. I had to have payment modifications because my 20-year-old Chevy Trailblazer began to stall whenever I traveled long distances and out of my town to doctor appointments to my Mother's cardiologist, it would stall at the Steak N Shake in ***** and it even stalled at the One Main Financial building in ******* I had to hope and pray that my Chevy Trailblazer would make it all the way home and had numerous engine misfires locally in ******* and in **** ***** GA. Four engine coil packs had to be replaced. It was either pay One Main or just be stranded at the car repair shop once again because they require payment at the time of repairs and service.  Then the car's radiator blew making the car not driveable. Everything that went wrong with my 20-year-old Trailblazer did. <br/> <br/> Then things fell apart with my house. Displaced two times by a tree that dropped limbs every time it rained and had straight-line winds- producing tornadoes. Displaced a last time by the same tree when I had to do payment arrangements with a tree cutting service to remove this deadly tree and pay out of pocket for a new mast, new meter box, and a few shingles. <br/> <br/> I don't makeup stories about my car or my house. I don't make up any excuses when it comes to what is going on in my life. Nor do I lie. <br/> <br/> One Main has kept me from obtaining a used car because it was less than what they wanted to approve. <br/> <br/> I'm not subjecting my 20-year-old car to a trip out of my county to pay a pay-off. As I have often said, \"The car will not make it to your location and will be sending this check via certified mail! It will arrive tomorrow or Tuesday. Since Monday is a HOLIDAY. I expect my Title via Certified Mail! I expect a receipt of PAID OFF STATUS' via Certified Mail. I expect this loan to be over and done with.\""

  "body": "I was referred to OneMain a few weeks ago and filled out an application for a small loan.  Almost immediately, I was bombarded with emails and multiple phone calls telling me I was pre-approved (I saved them all).  I talked to the agent (e.g.:  commission-based sales person) on Tuesday and was told to upload paystubs to a portal.  I opened an account and did so.  An appointment was set for Friday morning to close on the loan.  I did not hear from OneMain or the sales person.  I received no communication at all between Tuesday and Friday.   When I showed up, I was told there was a problem with the paystub I had uploaded.  Of course, I didn't bring it with me because no one told me I had to.  The agent seemed shocked that I didn't bring the title to the truck I was using as collateral or had driven it (it's a vehicle parked in my barn that I normally don't drive).  I told her that she did not tell me to bring the title or the truck, and she replied \"it was a busy week and I didn't have time to call you.\"   In the end, there was no loan.    I tried to call customer service at OneMain, but their mailbox was full.  I tried to email and received a \"your emails is blocked\" reply (which I have saved).   Don't use this company, they seem to be the usual under-educated, under-performing, lack of care sales people who know nothing about customer service, the lending industry or basic standards for writing a small, secured loan.   I've cross-filed this complaint with Lending Tree (who referred me) and Yelp.   Don't use this company.   "

  "body": "I was on a covid19 leave from work and applied for unemployment because I missed 2 weeks of work. I called in and asked to have my payment pushed out because I had no funds. I was offered a deferment to pay part of my payment and then defer the rest. I set up a payment for the amount on the 25th for around 109. Well on the 17th I get a 36.00 NSF fee due to no funds in my account when a payment tried to get pulled. I call in and it was a mistake on their end where the payment wasn't canceled for the automatic payment. Then I was told to bring in the copy of the NSF fee and I will be reimbursed. Well I live in Blaine now and to drive there is 38 minutes so I said that is not an option. Then I was told to send it through mail. I don't have stamps or Envelopes. So I was told I can have one sent to me through mail. If I'm hurting and can't make my payment what would make you think I can wait for my 36.00 in gas money for probably 2 weeks? Then I was told to go and have it printed at UPS and fax it. To print its 3.00 to fax its over 6.00 and I said I will do that if I can be reimbursed for that as well but nope. So then I was told I can upload it to their website and I had to call another number to get into my account and then do it. I spent 33 minutes on the phone getting all that reset and then the person telling me that they never heard of what I was asking about uploading the document. I work over nights, back to work and working 12 to 13 hours a day, 1 kid home all day with me still doing distance learning and 2 others that need to be dropped off and picked up from school. So even dealing with this is not a good situation for me. From the very beginning I asked if I can just e mail it, there is no bank info as far as someone being able to use my account and I feel just fine sending it through email but was denied being able to do that. So I call back when I have time a couple days later after they pulled again from my account for 219.00 and give me ANOTHER fee!!!! Still the same run around. I clearly stated I moved too far away from them to drive there and also was asked to go to my bank and have them fax it. My bank is in woodbury so even further out then where they are located. So now I get to just eat the 2 36.00 fees because I have no other options. If they send me the Envelope by the time I get it, still have to somehow print off the paperwork which will still cost me to go to ups to do, and then they get it back I'll already be paid and won't even need the funds. It makes me sad to think they are making it this hard for me to get my gas money back. "

I have automatic draft which I setup to come out my account before my payment was due so I definitely had a problem with the 15.00$ a month late fee accumulating 135.00$. After talking the to manager, I paid the 135.00$ that I didn't agree with and continued with my automatic draft. This month, May, I review my online account again and the late fees have accumulated to another 75.00$. Two weeks before I checked my account, a CS representative called me and offered me additional funds/loans. I asked her if my account was updated and she said it was. I called the ******** office, and the very rude, very disrespectful, young caucasian  female I talk to about my account  told me that my account looked like it was being paid ahead of time until it was close to the due date, then the computer would show it late and charge me late fees. AGAIN... she wanted me to pay late fees on an account that I had an automatic draft on, that I had already caught up almost 6 months ago. Why is my account STILL FALLING BEHIND. what are these people doing with my money? Putting it in your pocket !!!!. I ask the speak to the manager (Michael) who was equally as rude and told me several different stories before I got off the phone with him. The end result was, he could have waivered the late payments, which he did not, and I was being charged late payments for over a year on a partial payment of 30.00$ as far as I can tell from my account. The entire experience has been sooooo unworth it. I even asked the manager for the district manager's number who he said was unavailable. I asked to have my account moved to another store. These people do not have the best interest of the customer or even the company. I definitely don't TRUST them with my money."

I had NEVER been informed by this institution of the increase for an entire year, which every company I deal with advises me of beforehand. $938.00 is a huge chunk to suddenly pay, and no offer of making payments on it.

After providing more proof I was again asked for more records. I asked what would be the amount of the loan if I didn't provide more proof of what I make in a month. I was told that the loan amount would go down, go down to what I applied for. They were asking records of my monthly salary for a loan amount that I didn't apply for.Â  The amount would be MORE THAN what I wanted. I asked the so called branch manager why was the loan manager (Dee) asking for more records if I'm approved for the loan amount I applied for.Â Â  The loan amount \"somehow\" became more than what I applied for. I was later told that I was approved the amount that I applied for and also some forms needed to be signed but they could be signed electronically to finalize the loan. I was then transfered back to the loan officer (Dee) and she told me to wait till Monday to come in at 930am because 9am was not a good time for her.Â  I said let's make it 10am so she can be at her best since the loan amount was messed up. Now Im at the branch in the flesh and I am being told that I'm being declined because loan officer (Dee) could not get in contact with me. I was just on the phone with customer service, the branch manager and the loan officer (Dee)Â  Friday that how I knew to come in Monday, I set the appointment up with loan officer (Dee). I feel like decision are being made off appearance or they want a particular client in mind. I felt didiscriminated against Loan officer (Dee) did no further credit check and didn't ask for my ID. Made me wait to walk in on Monday to tell me I'm declined because she couldn't get in contact with me even though I was on the phone with her this past Friday. With all we have have to deal with now and days an loan application should not be like this. The practices done at this firm seem unethical destructive and this can reflect negatively on my credit.

I told them that if they added more, it would not get paid until the end of the loan.  After 2 years they called trying to get me to take out another loan and it would include what wasn't paid from previous loan.  I told them I would pay at the end of the five years and to stop calling me.  They called everyday and left harassing messages on my phone, then start calling everyone that I had listed on my reference list.  It got so bad (John the Manager), that I finally blocked them from my phone...then they started calling from different numbers (which I have proof).  To make matters worse, now they want to mess up my credit, which I worked hard to get a good score, by saying they are adding 30 days late to my record.  What a desperate company.    In the beginning I remember them asking me to write a good review for them, now i see why."

This was a lie, they will let you cancel however, your payment does not lower rather than come off the end of the loan...so the lower payment I was looking for which is the entire reason I refinanced didn't happen. Thought that was pretty shady.  Next problem - my last loan payment with the previous lender was split bi-weekly but they set this up as monthly telling me after first payment, I can switch it to bi weekly. Called to switch over, signed online to approve this change and all. Come to find out the date was the only thing that changed and I still paid my full loan amount. The issue is I only transferred the bi-weekly payment and it over drafted the full amount plus an overdraft fee. They canceled the full payment and admitted the mistake and told me I just needed to pay 2 payments by first payment of the next month. I received an email confirmation that the full payment was canceled and to re set up the bi weekly payments once the payment was returned.  Unfortunately this was also wrong, they took the full payment again only 2 days later while I'm out of state and now we are stranded as that was our gas money to get back home. We can't get ahold of anyone at their office as they are closed over the weekends.  The people are nice, they will get you refinanced and approved but it seems that's where the strength of their training is, get people in the loan and screw the rest. I just paid a full car payment that wasnt budgeted for (we budgeted for split payments which we signed paperwork for) plus $32 in overdraft fee and a $32 returned payment fee."

  "body": "If I could give negative stars, I certainly would. My son went to OneMain for a car loan. He asked me to cosign for him as I have excellent credit. I will do every thing in my power to keep people from being ripped off by this company. My credit score immediately took a hit by 6 points just for talking to them. Once we found out what interest rate they were offering, we took our business elsewhere. Then, this company had the audacity to send me a declination letter. THEY think they declined me? I never even filled out their application. I Emailed them back 3 times to quit bugging me about filling out the app. I had found a better deal with another institution. And then I get this letter in the mail .  If you need money for a car or something, please DON'T be fooled by their friendliness and charm!!! They do talk a very sweet talk, but they don't care one iota about building your credit back up.  "

They requested my title to do so. I agreed with the understanding that when I pay this down by half they would release the title back to me. I called today agreed to run my credit so I could paydown on the loan by 60% thus releasing my title back to me. Since the time I took this loan out I paid off another car, took care of numerous balances and reduced my credit cards. They came back with a Lower amount to offer and still wanted to keep my title. This is a pure CASE of BAIT and SWITCH if any ATTORNEYS see this please give me a call I would like to Sue them for this Thank you."

  "body": "Tried to payoff a loan early. The branch manager could not tell me what the principal of my loan amount was without interest. I simply asked for the payoff total that is actually owed on the remainder of the loan with no interest. He had no clue. I explained to him that there would not be interest on the remainder of the loan if I paid it off early and he agreed but told me he had no idea what the payoff would be without the interest. Talked in circles. Had no clue what \"unearned interest\" was. I suggest they get better training. There's no reason to pay off a loan early if OneMain is going to charge interest anyway simply because they don't know how to subtract the difference. I'm not paying off the loan if its not in my interest to do so.   I will NOT return to OneMain again."

  "body": "I just started a new loan with One Main Financial.  I made my first payment without issue. Then I made a larger payment in the middle of the month.  The next day I checked my balance which was still too high for what the balance should reflect based on the extra payment I just made. When I called to inquire about this, the guy said the \"loan amount\" within their app doesn't reflect interest.  Between the date of my statement March 17th and the additional payment I made, March 23rd, how did I accrue over $46.00 in interest that is not reflected in my loan balance. I think these are some shady practices. I will be paying this off in the next day or two and be done with them. They don't deserve to have anyone's business. "

  "body": "I used this company to get myself out of a tough situation and they completely screwed me over. I had signed up for the unemployment insurance when I consolidated my loans with my car. Not long after that, I was unemployed due to childcare issues, and shortly after that, COVID happened and I was unable to find a job. They had told never gave me ANYTHING about the terms and conditions of that specific insurance, (along with the other policy's they somehow scammed me into making me think was a good idea to add onto the loan.) I got released from my job because I had missed too many days because of child care issues. They asked me for my last paystub. I had 37.2 hours and they said, \"oh well since you didn't work 40 hours you don't qualify for the insurance.\" Then said they put the money back. Um WHAT?! I signed up for UNEMPLOYMENT insurance... in caseI got UNEMPLOYED!! So then in the MIDDLE of COVID they said I could defer my payments for a few months and THEN told me I had no other option rather than to do a \"loan modification,\" in which I STILL made half of my payment each month. So now I am trying to pay off my loan early. They tell me my payoff is 21k when I only borrowed like 20k and been paying for a while now! This is absolutely disgusting. He says since I did a loan modification that makes it a interest bearing loan. Completely screwed me over. Now, instead of just paying off the balance WITHOUT the YEARS of interest left, they won't allow me to do that and say I have to now, \"settle.\" Which I don't want to settle, I want to show that I paid my loan off. These people are scam artists. DO NOT EVER GO TO THEM!"

We paid more than what was due biweekly and have never been late with a payment.  In fact, we are nearly 7 months paid in advance.  When we first called months agao to get the car released so we could sell it, they gave us an amount that nearly equaled the amout that we took out for additional money when we added the car as collateral.  ???what??? At that time when I talked to the Office rep she was extremly rude and made highly condisending remarks.  Today 3/22/21 I called back again after additional months of paying on the loan and did the new quoted \"payoff\" to get the title released and this new person that assisted was just as bad.  I asked how I could go about getting something from them right away that shows the lien is released and they said I could not stop there to get anything that I had to wait days/weeks to get the paperwork and title so I could sell the car.   ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE COMPANY!!!  I will continue to make my payments to pay off the balance and probably will start paying more.  I cant get away from them fast enough!"
