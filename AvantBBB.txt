"I would score this a negative star if I cud. After reading some reviews &amp; realizing I am not the only one who is experiencing problems w Avant, I wish I had come here earlier. It amazes me that Avant has been able to get away w their slimy, illegal, (imo) tactics as long as they have. I too had fraud Chgs on my acct. After over 12 months of back &amp; forth, Avant decided to write off my balance and close my acct. Naturally, this has caused my credit score to lower 200 pts! They think this is over but I have just begun. Class Action Anyone? Contact: *************************, ****** via FB&nbsp;&nbsp;"
"I only gave this company one star because you don't allow me to go further without giving any stars! I applied for this credit card and never received it. I was sent an email by their company in January asking why I had not activated. I replied and advised **** was never received. After no reply I called and was told card was sent on January 6, 2024 to the wrong city and a replacement was issued in February. I advised on February 15, 2024 card was still not received after at least 4 telephone conversations advising I had received a bill for $39 for my annual fee due March 1, 2024 for a card a still never received. I have email communication where they replied to my concerns as I was told by ALL the staff, there was nothing they could do. I had to pay the bill whether the card had been received or not since it was annual. So my question was since the card has yet to be received, shouldn't the annual fee be due once the card was received and activated? Initially the last person spoken to stated your annual fee will not be due until you activate. I asked for that in writing and after a ten minute hold, she came back and said sorry the fee will be due in January. So my question was if I don't receive the card until April, the annual fee instead of 12 months becomes 9 months THIS COMPANY HAS ALL EMPLOYEES WHO BARELY SPEAK AND UNDERSTAND ENGLISH AND WHEN I ASKED FOR A SUPERVISOR, AFTER AN EXTENDED HOLD, WAS TOLD THERE WERE NONE BUT THE ANSWER WAS I STILL HAD TO PAY THE *** ON A CARD NOT IN MY POSSESSION. LEGAL SCAMMERS!!!"
"Omg, where do I start. I have a credit card with them and disputed a payment made to Aspen Dental which ****************** states they refunded it back to my card and now Avant saying they did not and I will have to submit a dispute with them after 10 business days the refund was supposed to be submitted which will be today, so now they say Avant I need to wait two additional days after to submit on their end which will take up to 90 days. I spoke with a supervisor which was no help at all basically to tell me the same thing a representative said. I'm just going to pay this card off and stick with Discover and ************ I don't even want this card anymore. All this hassle over $191.80 less than $200 bucks. I can't. Avant loss me as a customer. I'm paying them off and closing my account with them.. Sad..&nbsp;&nbsp;"
I had called the credit card company to let them know I was in the hospital and I was not going to be able to make the payment and they put me on a plan and closed my account. DO NOT USE THIS PEOPLE FOR A CREDIT CARD THEY ARE HORRIBLE !!!!
"I had a very sad experience with their customer service. I spoke with a gentleman that refused to listen to my circumstances and continued to cut me off. When I request to speak to a supervisor, he placed me on hold and continued to give me a general answer. He halfway apologized for making me feel unheard when I requested a supervisor but it shouldn't take the threat of a complaint for someone to show some compassion towards a caller. Especially when one is coming to you and explaining financial hardship. I didn't yell or cuss him out either. I stayed calm and asked politely for further assistance. It was very upsetting and unwarranted. 10 out of 10, Do NOT recommend. "
Terrible customer service with the customer service agent keeping me on hold for 30 minutes. When I inquired about filling out a survey on the experience that had occurred she informed me that the company does not have customer service surveys. I am closing this account.  
"I would not recommend this credit card to anyone who want to use it for credit repair/building. I opened the account for this exact purpose, and then got sent away for military training. I came back to a high balance on the card. Submitted a fraud claim for the two charges on the card and never heard from them again. Zero communication. No emails with updates, phone calls or paper mail. I called in and spent 3.5 hours on the phone being transferred from person to person. I learned that they reversed the $60 charge and the $16 charges but refused to erase the late fees and interest on these fraud charges, claiming that they are UNABLE to offer me that service, even though they advertise ZERO Fraud Liability. There is now a balance on the card that keeps gaining interest and late fees and they refuse to assist me even they VERIFIED there was fraud, by reversing the two original charges. So a card that is meant to repair/build credit has now damaged it even further due to fraud, bad business practices and a high balance that I should not be responsible for.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"
Wish I could give them 0 stars. After using Bill *** I was told that Avant would not post to my account until 14 days! The funds left my bank account within minutes. The absurdity of 14 days in todays times is ridiculous! I paid my card in full and cancelled the card! 
"IF YOU HAVE A PO BOX MAILING ADDRESS, DO NOT GET THIS CARD.I was instantly approved for a credit card after applying off of Credit Karma. When filling out the account information, I put down my permanent address. I was expecting to be able to add a different po box mailing address later on, as I live in a town that only uses po boxes and does not offer street deliveries for mail. I sent an email to ask for my mailing address to be updated. I was told this is against the policy they have for addresses. (PO Boxes are not allowed to be set as an address on your account.)I sent another email explaining I just wanted to update my mailing address, and not my physical address. I was told to call in to speak with someone. I called in and was told having the CC mailed to my PO Box is not possible. I asked to speak to a manager at least 3 times, I was ignored and was told repeatedly what I wanted was not possible. I finally gave up and told them to close my account. They proceed to close my account, and I ask again to speak to a manager. After an almost 10 minute hold, I am informed the manager is ""on a call"" and they can leave a message. I had my account with this company for a grand total of ONE DAY! Not worth the headache.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"
"I paid my statement balance in full on January 17, cycle closed on January 19. I received a bill for the finance charges that accrued ******* the billing cycle. I called the company for waiver of the finance charge I was told it couldn't be waive due to me not paying the two previous billed balance in full and is policy of the company. This is so wrong unacceptable.. ************ is not for the consumers in which they benefit from. I paid what was charged and paid finance charge on what was owed. This is a company taking advantage of consumers whos financially handicap with their credit.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"
"I made a payment to this company via cashier's check. They cashed the check according to my bank, and a week later they still have not applied the payment I made to my balance.  They then proceeded to tell me that I would accrue interest on the full amount shown (which is now over limit because the payment wasn't applied when it was received) and that it could take 14 more days for the payment to be applied.  Meanwhile, I'll be accruing interest on my now over limit card for those 14 days because ""that's how it works"" according to the agents.  This company is not reputable and are using shady practices. "
Under no circumstances do not apply for a credit card with this company. They ask for very personal private information and the customer service is trash. I have several ********************** cards and not once was my banking information asked for. Stay away it's not worth the headache.
"Worst credit card ever! The say annual fee will be paid monthly but take the whole annual fee once you apply. Then I called to get a dec before my payment due date in February. They said they dont do due date changes, how convenient and non customer friendly. I ask for a manager there was not one to assist me. They said I would have to call back but was informed again no due date change was available. I ask if they could have a manager contact me. The representative stated call backs have to be approved by a manager. I would not recommend this card to anyone they do not make sense what so ever customer service is dead here."
I applied for the card was accepted. They gave me a $2000 line of credit never mailed me. The card is 30 days now since I was approved and they keep lying to me telling me they sent the card do not deal with this company because theyre on the Better Business Bureaus number ONE list for **************. Theyre also on the FBIs list for complaints. 
"This is a very poor credit card company. I called to have a late fee waived since I had never been late before. They refused. The people who call themselves customer service were extremely loud and rude, the 'supervisor' was no better.   Refused to give me an explanation as to why she would not waive a late fee. Unbelievable.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"
I paid my account off with a paper check and and they ran the check before the next dew date and are still charging me interest they were hard to work with I feel like they were trying to just charge me just one last time and very rude.&nbsp;&nbsp;
"I can not log in to their website. I've tried form my desktop, laptop and iPhone. I have no idea what I owe and for what. They don't send statements and I can't see my account. I have to call to make a payment. Then the girl on phone has to ask **************************** I wish someone else was trying to pay my bills. And, I have to leave the building at work to make the call. I was a week late because of trying to pay online and I have been busy. She has the nerve to ask me why I'm behind. Why are you a credit card company with no way to access my account?"
I am trying to make a payment but they are unwilling to provide me the ability to update my email address to ensure a receipt of payment. This is fly by night company!!!
"I applied for a card and was accepted.  I went online to their site to establish a login and was able to do that but the entire page was blank.  I tried over and over again the next few days, called their customer no-service and they said they would ""escalate"" the issue.  I received an email today saying because of their issues they are closing my account.  I never asked them to close it but they took it upon themselves to do so.  This company is beyond sketchy.  I guess in the end I am glad it turned out this way.  There are far too many credit card companies to choose from without being stuck with one that cannot even maintain a working website.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"
"Great at first. Went on vacation. Could not use the card anywhere. **************** said all of the stores I went to didn't have machines that were compatible with the card. I was frustrated as this was the only card I took. I was advised to use the **** Went to **** Declined. Call and canceled card. Ended up paying balance off IN FULL. Just to find out they have been reporting negative to my credit for months. Called them. They said I owed $13 in interest. I wanted confirmation if I paid the $13 my account would be closed. **************** stated no because Id have interest on top of the $13. I asked to pay the $13 and whatever the internet was on the $13. **************** again told me no, I would have interest on the interest that's on the $13. I just want this account closed and to stop reporting to my credit, but there's literally no way out.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"
"Worst mistake I ever made.  Last year around this time I applied for and was approved for a credit card.  Took awhile, but each morning I check Informed Delivery to see what to expect in the mail, and the card was there.  However, when I retrieved my mail later in the day there was no card.  I immediately called Avant and explained what happened.  Was told to wait a few days even though it had been scheduled for delivery that day.  Then I received an email thanking me for activating my card and I called again only to find out someone had gotten the card and used it to buy sneakers at a Foot Locker far from my home.  Now, I am a 76 year old woman with mobility issues,  Definitely would not be buying sneakers. I notified Avant and was forwarded to their fraud department.  I explained what happened and they said they would investigate.   My account was blocked meanwhile, and they actually told me to make a payment on it.  No way was I going to pay for someone else's sneakers.  Okay, fast forward to about a month later.  I received a new card in the mail, my account was unlocked, and I was free to use it.  I made purchases and payments.  Everything was settled or so I thought. Several months later I received an email from the fraud department.  My account was again locked because per them ""I said I never applied for the account"" and was a victim of identity theft.  They NEVER responded to any of the emails I sent.  My account was blocked again. By now I just wanted to pay it off and close it.  The same nonsense has started again now in December.  Neither the fraud department nor compliance ever responds to me.  I want it taken off my credit report,  I am at my **** end.  Can't get anyone to respond.  Please help.&nbsp;&nbsp;"
"If I could give zero stars I would! I have tried to call their phone numbers listed, and get this number is unavailable at this time for two weeks. I've emailed them, with no response. I'm in good standing and every attempted purchase is declined. I don't know what to do! Fraudulent company?&nbsp;&nbsp;"
I got the card but could not activate it thru online or customer service who hung up on me when I asked why they were charging me a $59 yearly fee when it states clearly on the advertised card that the yearly fee was $39 plus they turned it in to my credit report that it was a new account and it had been almost 2 months and was still not activated plus charging me the $59 I got this card to help my credit not destroy it well the $69 was out of a $300 limit so it dropped my score in a major way when I called customer service this lady was so rude and unconcerned about any of it so i had to close it trying to save my credit only to ge penalized for closing a brw account they are a joke and a scam if you are working on building credit DO NOT EVEN CONSIDER THESE THIEVES AND SCAMMERS.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Avant is the worst company ever. They sit and lie to you over the phone.  Give you wrong numbers to call when requesting corporate number. Use tactics to charge extra fees while telling you all is well with your account. Have made demands to receive payment in a specific form of currency and not All legal forms of U.S. currency.  Refuses to escalate issues or respond to Billing error issues.  
"This company should be banned from doing business they have payment from my OWN bank account that I have proof they have received and they have marked my account late, damaged my credit, and fraudulently stated they have no record of payments when I have proof WISH READ THESE REVIEWS they have a call center where they BARELY spoke English could not understand and did not answer questions talked around the questions I asked. FTC needs to shut these guys down.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"
"Only got this card so that I had revolving credit to increase my score b/c I was working on getting a mortgage. 1 star is way too much but it is the lowest you can give to leave a review. This has been THE WORSE credit card company I have ever had to deal with. They find ways to add fees and then refuse to move them, all in an effort to ruin your credit and take all your money. I intend to file a complaint with corporate which are probably just as s***** I intend to recover monies they added to my account and bring awareness about what kind of sharks they are as well as encourage everyone to run far and fast the opposite way when it comes to this place. I would NOT recommend this card or company. I wish I never signed up for it. I did get my mortgage and have since closed this card. They are still adding fees making it impossible to pay off. Absolutely insane.&nbsp;&nbsp;"
"I applied for a consolidated loan because it said I have ""outstanding"" approval odds. I fill out the application and then say I am pre qualified up to $12,000 dollars so I apply. After giving them pay stubs, bank accounts, and pic of my ID with a selfie, I did not even receive an email and/or a notification on the website of completion. Two days later, I log into the Avant website and it says ""Verify your personal loan application information"" so I click on the link and everything says completed. I call them and ask what the status is and wanted to make sure I submitted everything correctly. They stated that I do not need to do anything on my end and wait for a email/phone response -- they also did a hard credit pull. It is ridiculous that this company does not let the end-user know the status of your application and keep you in limbo for days on end. At least say after you're done submitting a ton of personal info that the application process is complete and is pending."
I called and was initially hung up on. I called back and asked for a supervisor and was told there was none. I asked for a refund check for overpayment and was told I could not get one. My payment has been on pending status for a week. I was told to call back in 2 weeks to MAYBE be approved for a refund check. The only action I could complete was closing the account. The people who are in the call center need further training. My problem is still not handled. Worst customer service ever! BUYER BEWARE!!
this Avant credit card financial love to ripped off peoples daily even when I've paying off the balances n closed the accounts and they did reports me to the credit bureau that I'm still owe them couples dollars for late. so people need to stay far away from this scammers Avant&nbsp;credit card company n hope BBB will take a look inside the crazy organization.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
"I've had loans twice in the past with this high interest company and paid them off, every dime. I decided to use them again to pay off a just as high ******** loan. I went through the formalities got pre approved and all. Last step to pull your credit, a hard pull to verify its identity and credibility. All done, then wham we forgot to tell you we need more INFO by sending in bank statement and or using a podcast to identify your source of income all after you just told me the last step... Cant be trusted to much vulnerable info for no good reason there fore I cancelled the loan request and rated this company a fraud... "
"Avant is a joke.  All I need is my account number.  They say they can't see it on their system due to security reasons.  I'm sorry, what?  I verify who I am.  What other security reasons is there?  Don't get this card or do any kind of business with them.  Stay as far away as you can.  "
They charged me a late fee and I never received a card. I tried to pay off the 115 dollar amount and no one would help me. It's now on my credit report. This company is a scam and the customer service people twice were rude. I just wanted it off and I was willing to pay but they never helped. 
"I became disabled and asked for a program to pay off my debt. I could not work and the late fees went up to ******.  They said that they could not get me into a program until they closed my account, so I contacted the ************************ and they closed my account but not before they spiked the late fees up to ****** more of what owed. I got a lawyer to help me with my debt. and this lousy company will not budge and would rather lose all of the money than offer a settlement amount.&nbsp;&nbsp;"
Decline to refund my overpayment.  I got a loan from Avant for **** I made a payment  of 500$ within 3 months.  Every month I paid 100$ sometimes more.  I over paid 700$ I emailed them about my refund 3 times they did not reply.  I called them they decline my refund. 
"This company really has a terrible system and employees. Applied for a loan, no confirmation, no update, no detail answer. But the employees kept asking what I need to submit, which I did those all and even I had to confirmed with them if they have my stuffs. Pulled my credit for nothing and twice in a row got an AUTO Email that my application being cancelled because of the timeframe they have. Not Approved, Not Rejected but Cancelled because they don't know how to handle my loan and my completed data that they asked me to submitted. Waste my credit, waste my time, waste my patience, while I need the answer the most if I get it or not, and I don't want to ****** by applying to another lender that will hurt my credit again and re-do the steps again plus will take times as well, while I do need the money quick to do my plan. But it is not, I cant. Now its even worse situation for me and with no money. Thanks Avant!!!! Thanks for ruin everything!!!!&nbsp; &nbsp;"
"My credit limit is $300 , my available credit is $275 but it said on Oct 5 2023 , I was -$1 , woke up on October 6 2023 now it says it's -$10 and no one at the costumer service number can't give me am explanation on how is that possible "
Pulled a hard inquiry after their site said it wouldn't affect my credit report.&nbsp;
Terrible company in kahoots with Credit Karma. Tells customers they have outstanding approval odds then deny your application. Perhaps Avant and Credit Karma are getting something out of this monetarily speaking. 
"AVANT CREDIT CARD is the BIGGEST JOKE I've ever encountered, they allow fraudulent transactions on your account and then make you responsible for those transactions and if you don't pay it they're reporting it to your credit bureau to mess your credit up, meanwhile I didn't receive a card for MONTHS and when I finally got the new card more fraudulent transactions were processed on that new card so I STOPPED paying that bill because I hadn't used that credit card in MONTHS yet I had transactions from HERTZ RENTAL CAR, TOLLS, ETC. this company should be SHUT DOWN, I'm Fighting them as we speak because my payment history is phenomenal but because of this JOKE OF A COMPANY now my credit score went down FOR NO REASON AT ALL. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS CREDIT CARD TO MY WORST ENEMY PLEASE PLEASE RUN RUN RUN IF IT'S NOT TO LATE!!!! "
"How this company is still in business I dont know.  Terrible and I think youd get a better loan rate from a loan shark, at least better customer service.  They call 3 times a day every single day and leave a robocall type voicemail. Ive called to get number removed from their call list and they want my social security number to remove it? I dont think so!  What a scam.  Oddly we have never even initiated any type of loan with them we believe maybe the person who had the cell number before us may have but not sure as they wont tell us anything when they call. The message says to call them back right away but when we call they ask for a social security number.  Please avoid this company. They feed off of taking advantage of people who have no choice.  "
Never received a card but yet the billed me and reported that I owed them money called they say I owe them nothing but yet they keep sending me bills
"This stupid credit card (AVANT) needs to be shut DOWN completely.  In 2022 I had an account with them, paid the account off, then small charges started appearing after the account was CLOSED.  I called for an investigation with their fraud department and while they were investigating the charges they sent me another credit card with a different number which I did not ask for, CRAZY!  I cut up the credit card and sent another letter to closed this freaking account.  They also put a delinquent **** on my credit report for those charges which I did not incur.  Now, here I an in September 2023 and I just received a bill from them for an account that has been closed since 2022.  What the heck does it take to get through this stupid creditor???  I'm send a complaint to all three credit bureau's, I'm so DONE with them.  They are the worse credit card to have!"
I don't understand why the federal agency in charge of monitoring CC companies hasn't closed this joke of a company down yet. What a freaking joke.
"Early this year I was placed out of work from an injury and ended up having surgery. I attempted to contact the company several times to see if they had any programs to help me reduce the late fees or assist with me getting back on track. I even requested to speak with a manager and the representative stated at first no manager or supervisor was available. After several minutes on the phone and inquiring why I couldn't that's when he said one could give me a call back later because the representative was working from home. I never heard from a manager. In most emergency situations a company would normally work with customers trying to resolve their accounts. I used part of my last $50 trying to lower my bill which was over by $200. 2 days later Avant added on another $39 late fee with almost $15 interest which was useless. Their's nothing worst than to be out of work and recovering from major surgery while trying to tackle your debt. If you're looking for customer service, ********************** LLC definitely lacks it. I wouldn't recommend this company to no one. You never can predict what will happen with your health. "
"I had a $2000 credit limit. Charged items totaling $1400 and ALWAYS paid on time, never late, and the interest was close to 30%. Returned a couple of expensive items a couple of months after purchase totaling $1100. Overnight my credit limit dropped to $300!! They DID NOT send me an email or anything telling me this. I went to use the card and it was denied by the retailer. Looked at the app to see the limit dropped to $300. Called and they gave no excuse, said I'd receive a letter. When the letter FINALLY arrived it said the reason for the decrease was ""Credit Card Activity"". Apparently, you can't get any refunds without them getting back at you. Since then I quit using the card and paid them off. I will never use that card again! They're not getting $1 interest from me ever again! Avant = Horrible Credit Card! Don't get one."
Avant- did a hard credit inquiry without my authorization. It was supposed to be a pre qualification. The inquiry made my score go down!
"These people are unscruplous with shrewd, predatory business practices. They have been sued before, they changed their number, dropped Avant Credit to just Avant, same owners with questionable business practices, truth is they dont care, I wrote upper management an email before escalating this, no reply, no acknowledgement of any sort. I will not rest until they're investigated again, I have reached out to my Congresswoman's ******* reaching out to ******* attorney **************** as well. This people ran my credit while along having wrong information about me, then have the audacity to lie that they got the information from Transunion. Over a dozen phonecalls with their awfull robot like agents. They mixed up my account with an ex husband who is deceased, then turn around and say "" you need two paystubs to be considered for a loan"". I already emailed you and let you know I just started my job, so had just one paystub. I have phone recordings and emails to proof this, my credit is down almost 15 points from this pointless enquiry. They gather all sorts of information from you, just to waste your time and mislead consumers, it's quite evident from all reviews here, they just never learn and this has to stop immediately. Starting a petition on change.org as well. "
absolutely horrible did not care about the the already hi Apr just wanted to help my credit usage stay below %30 ( had a small splurge with my wife and over spent) they gave me a limit of $500 so after 2 years and better scores not one missed payment I asked for an increase hoping to get a much better deal.. another hard search on my credit file and They denied and raised my interest this card will never be used again... ps I had a card at the time with 7k limit....I applied at a way better company with cash back on all purchases.... so with multiple good standing accounts with higher credit lines $ scores yall chose to loose a customer my new cards apr is way lower and a limit of $9500 I would have been cool with a little better apr and $2500 limit and might have kept using yall. for small purchases. use them if you have to don't ever spend more then your monthly payment and pay before the due date at least a week early until you can get better cards. They were a let down day one for me.
"I entered a payment plan due to unexpected expenses to include car repairs. I was approved for the payment plan which they set up and arranged the dates . 2 months go by and I realized I am also accumulating late fees. I call in to speak with a rep and she would not assist me with my complaint. Once I asked for a manager she then asked for the reason for the transfer. I explained because you would not assist me in my complaint about the late fee. She has the nerve to say I didnt ask for assistance with the late fee. Thats your job; if Im complaining about the late fee, you should inform me of what you can help me with. Once I was sent to the supervisor, my request for waiving the late fee was submitted and my account was closed."
"I do wish I'd of read these reviews prior to applying for a card.First off, they are a shell company for ""*******"".  Secondly, you go through page after page of the online application process displaying ""Applying will not affect your credit score"".  Only for them to do a hard credit check (Without indicating so) before reaching a decision.  I'm pretty sure this is misrepresentation and fraud.  As it ultimately affects OUR credit scores.Do not fall for their ""pre-approved"" e-mails or the multiple attempts to harass you through the U.S. ************** (I've since filed a cease and desist).  I wanted to redistribute the funds in my other accounts.  Not deal with ***************** a faulty website, and morals that rank as worst, among all credit card companies.Just because they are proud of their **** stars rating.  Doesn't make us equally proud to allow them to tamper with our credit scores."
"terrible company,  don't waste your time! was trying to consolidate my debt same monthly payments I would pay but better apr, so I applied for the loan for DEBT CONSOLIDATION  then they deny me because I have a high balance on my available credit , so you hold my debt aginst me and deny me but the loan I'm applying for is for the debt your holding aginst me so my current debt will only be the loan! so why deny my application ? a debt consolidation loan is to pay my debt off im confused? terrible company I feel like so many people get denied falsy scam company,  10k loan making 88k a year and its denied ? 700 credit score well 713 doesn't add up they just want your information save yourself"
"They are blocking nearly every transaction I make with them for fraud protection but its literally just always still me trying to use my card. Fraud protection is great, but just randomly blocking one out of every two transactions a customer makes isnt protecting them from anything. Youre just blocking me from using my card."
"Took out a personal loan with this lender. Everything was ok until I had to make a sizable payment on the loan for the purposes of closing a mortgage. All the mortgage company required was a STATEMENT from them with my name, partial/full account number, and current balance. Not an unreasonable request. Except it was an absolute circus. Their customer service is outsourced to ***** and they are VERY LIMITED and scripted in how much they can help. Emailed resolutions. They emailed me back and told me to call customer service. Requested a supervisor numerous times only to be told they couldnt find one and would call me back. They never did. Literally kept everyone involved in this mortgage process waiting for something that should be routine. Going to pay off the rest of my loan and never look their way again. Look elsewhere for credit."
"Negative 10 stars...NOT A ONE STAR!!!!  Company is shady. Company has twice mailed out my new card to a wrong address. I called two different times to have them correct my address so as to receive my card. Upon third time calling them, csr told me that I must give proof documentation about my correct address??? What a bunch of morons."
"I am definitely disappointed that I am doing business with them. They are outsourcing their customer service reps, which unfortunately is nothing new with most businesses. The reps are not knowledgeable, not helpful, and seem very confused. The reps cannot answer basic information about your account, and only repeat themselves, sounding like a darn robot. It is very frustrating and annoying to try and get some resolution and account details, and I want to say they are just adding fees because the balances and amount due don't even make sense. It is a shame supposedly this is headquarter in *******, and I am speaking to people in a third world country when I am literally down the street haha. I have asked for a late fee waiver and they refuse to give me one. Not sure why. That is disturbing and they reply with this generic reply not justifying why a customer can't have one late fee removed if it is their first. I am going to work hard to pay this card off and close it, the headache is not worth it. It would be different if someone could truly help you and explain the information, but since they cannot, I figured I would try to seek help elsewhere. THEY ARE TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"This cant be legal! So I applied for Avant almost two months ago and never received a card. I called them asking them where is the card and they said theyll resend another one. I was sent a statement due for July 25th for ***** as an annual fee for a card I still dont have. Why am I being billed for a card I have zero access and thats not activated? Last time I checked, you only pay annual fees for activated cards! So now I have a bill without a card. "
"After paying off our loan and overpaying by over $300 Avant still has not issued our refund and it has been 20 days since our loan was paid in full. Every time we have contacted Avant, they say ""we will issue your refund in 2 - 3 weeks from the date when your loan was paid in full. We have the receipt that Avant sent us on June 16, 2023, showing it was paid in full. 3 weeks later still no refund. "
"Worst customer service ever. Don't use them, but if you already, do don't pay through the app. It charged me twice, and they won't refund the second charge.Absolutely terrible. STAY AWAY."
Scam !!!! All they do is day after day excuse after excuse and never even finish the loan process and do a hard pull on your credit. Absolutely no communication from them and when they do call their representatives cant even speak english.. find someone else 
"Worst customer service , waited 6 months for a new card "
I am a disabled veteran.* They will not allow you to change your due date. My pension comes in at the beginning of the month all my bills get paid at the beginning of the month. I don't know any company in this day and age that doesn't help their consumer pay their bill with the option to change their due date.* They do not show a true accounting ledger type ongoing balance before a transaction or payment and so on and so on so you cannot prove what you need to check out is accurate and correct.* Their security fraud feature is an excellent feature. But...When it thinks there's possible fraud the only alert you get is a phone call to answer the computer so it will leave your account open to use. That leaves too much error of not catching the computer at the right moment to answer its questions and if you use the card it then locks the account for fraud and it could take a week or so to reopen your card. It also leaves you to constantly constantly have to call the credit card representative which do not know what they're doing. And have them check and answer to see if any of those charges were fraud.I received a large amount of money and remodeled my apartment and bought all new furniture. The card was utilized and the security feature kept hitting I didn't realize the call came through so I missed my chance I used it again it declined my transaction so I had to call and have been doing this for 2 weeks.My card is now frozen cannot be used in any way shape or form they've had to escalate it and there is no time frame as to when they'll get to it or how long it will take.since I made so many transactions and so many calls to find out why it declines each time I call they need to confirm the transactions. Very good security protocol. But...If I called yesterday answered if those specific transactions were valid and were made but declined then why the next day when it does it again do I have to go back to the very beginning and start over every  time.
I paid the my card off ****** and on june 8 avant posted it to my account. now the card has a 0 balance.billing cycle is  May 18th to  June17th On june 17 avant charge me 3 84 interest on a 0 balance.All this is  on their records.  I will be force to file a complaint with the **************************    
"I sent an online payment through the bank on May 4th.  Avant- did not process the bank check until May 24th,  Payment was due 23rd.  They made me pay a late fee.  Bad business in my opinion. Bank said they mailed check on 4th."
I canceled this card and it shows on my credit report months and months later making me think they didn&rsquo;t actually cancel and I still have an open account with them.
This company is trash! Is there a negative 1 score I can give? Terrible customer service. Closed my account after I disputed a late payment with credit bureaus and FCR . They did me a favor anyway low credit limits and lies.... don't waste your time TERRIBLE COMPANY!
"This place is a scam! I was approved, they hit my credit and NEVER sent the credit card. I was approved in April and today is 5/31/23. And the customer service reps can not be bothered to help you past their scripts. Absolutely unprofessional! I wish I could remove them from my credit report without damaging my credit further. Thanks for taking advantage of people!"
I closed a credit card about 2 months ago and they still keep sending me statements via email and snail mail.  The account is zeroed out but they still keep sending the statements.  I do not owe them anything.  I will never do business with them again.  I called them on the phone and that did not help.
I went threw 4 people that work for this company in order to tell me that I was getting interest on my card win I pay a ****** dollars on it every week I have ***** left I payed a ****** dollars on it and the balance never went down and they don't want to give you the corporate number I promise from this day when I pay it off I will cancel it and I only put one star because it won't let you leave it like that if I can I will leave it balled no stars bad company bad customer service stay away 
"I moved to west ****** from north ****** and changed my address. Since I cant change my own address on the *** that I downloaded. I never heard of that I might say. Anywho, so they told me hey we going to have to issue you another card since you loss your card and was getting a new one and you changed your address.. ok fine. They told me 10 business days.. it never came . At this point I need the money depending on it and I called  them again just for them to apologize (bull crap) and guess what still never received my card 10 more business days later. I am so tired of calling, I have a balance on the card I do not want to pay off a card that I want to use and still have a high credit  limit on and still never receiving card. I even checked my old address mailbox with permission NOTHING I do not know what to dO at this point its nerve wrecking "
"I have been waiting since March 29th for a replacement card because mine had expired and everytime I call they say they will send out a new one and it will be ***** days to arrive this is the 3rd card they are sending out supposedly its now May 19th and I just keep getting the same lie this is very unprofessional and unexcepable, I asked if they could ***** the replacement card and they don't do that she said its crazy "
"They locked my online account and would not let me make payments through the website. They changed my email address without my consent and when I called them to fix it, they said they were not able to do so. I did a reset password request on the website, and it failed to send me correspondence, I cant get into the site to make a payment. Absolutely the WORST company ever. Is there a 0 stars available? "
Was approved for a credit card. Recvd card. Stsrted using card. Have not recvd 1st bill. Avant decided to than review my acct and put a stop on it due to my national debt acct i have had for 3 years and its almost done. I was on vacation and they put a hold on my card. Had been using it. Thank goodness for friends that helped me out. All Avant customer service and a supervisor would say was sorry fir your incinvenience. DO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR BUSINESS. HORRIBLE COMPANY. 
They do not record your bill pay checks until the payment is late. Pay off and close account ASAP
"Received a letter today from avant stating that my application for a loan could not be approved.  Fact is that I never applied for any loan from them or anyone else.  The letter stated that the credit bureau they used was transunion.  My first step was to call the company to find out what this letter was about.  The rep was very questioning.  He wanted the Last 4 of my social, my address and dob . When he continued to ask for my email I refused.  He kept talking about transferring me to the fraud department.  I told him to transfer me and I'm not giving him anymore information.  He refused to transfer me and told me that without the email he was going to end the call. Next call I made was to Transunion who informed me that there was never any report inquiry from Avant . This letter was all a Rouge.  I have no idea what they were trying to accomplish but they were certainly unprofessional when I called.  Supposedly they have all my information so why keep asking me questions.  I would run from this company.  I also had to freeze all my credit bureaus accounts for safety and security.  "
"I have been charged ***** twice in late charges. The money was taken out of my money on the credit card. I called them and said, how can I make a payment if my card is lost? The agent said, you can still make a payment without the credit card numbers! She was VERY rude. My new card came 2 days after the call, that's when I saw that they had taken my money"
The worst credit card period. I had a specific limit and the company took it upon themselves to reduce my limit. I then called over 6 months ago when this happened and told them to cancel this account period and I just received an email regarding my account that is still open. This is fraud and this company shouldnt be able to keep an account on your ********************** that you specifically asked to be closed due to their actions. Help how can I get this resolved and hold the company responsible for keeping an account on my ********************** that should be closed?
I have an open fraud claim with them that has not been resolved for about a year. I am being charged the full amount and when I call to speak to someone no one is able to assist me. The balance is now being reported to the credit bureaus and no one seems to care. I am told I will get a call back that never happens. 
"This card has high interest, no implemented fee waiver for urgent matters. They are very inconsiderate with their card holders. I cant wait to pay this card off."
"After hour and hours of research regarding companies that accepted fair credit and crossing those on my list that were questionable, I attempted their pre-qualification and found they don't accept joint loan holders so I attempted with both myself and my husband, they denied both of us despite a having the funds to repay the loan and their **************** was not helpful or courteous."
"Do not do business with Avant. They are deceptive and even with proof if their poor information to customer they would not do ANYTHING about it. I closed my account January 6, 2023. Paid off entire balance that the rep told me. Never did she mention that there would be more charges after that day. I received letter saying it wa closed. Then 2 month later I get a bill for like $ 35 that included late fees.  I tried calling and numerous times the representative said their lines where down. Finally got through and asked what is was all about and they said ""trailing charges"". Noon eever told me to go back and see if I had such! I then asked that I pay only the ""trailing charges"" and they should remove the late fees that I didn't need to pay die to thermos lack of communication.  Nope. Woudnt do it. I am forced to pay this amount now to keep them from going into my credit report. The issue isn't the $35 the issue is their lack of communication when closing these accounts is deceptive and when they pull the recording they will hear that the representative NEVER told me that. This is a class action lawsuit in thr making. I went from a couple dollars that I still don't know how i owed if I paid off the account in full to paying $35. No. These people need to learn to be honest. This matter is going to court. And they will lose. Its black and white. "
Terrible a scam at best when there is a issue 
"This company is a scam, they have refused to close the account when I paid it off in full charging late fees on a paid off account. They have been unreachable and customer service representatives lie and hang up on you. No statements received after paid off then they started saying I owed late fees. I have disputed this account with every reporting agency nothings being done."
"I would give a 0 if possible. I set up automatic payment plan with them. During this time was told there would be no late fees. My statement clearly shows that every day after my scheduled payment, a late fee. When I called about it they said they are sorry that I was mislead and that it was not communicated but there would still be a late fee? How does that even make sense when payments are being made every month. They said there is not anything they could do and just kept reading off of some script repeating themselves. No real help or assistance offered. They just keep adding asinine fees to the account so that you can never pay off the card! Told them to cancel the card immediately. Taking advantage of people and stealing money!"
Well discusted. I paid the balance I was told on 3.17.23. On 3.17.23 was charged a ***** annual fee after I paid it off. The annual fee covers 4.23.23 to ******. That's only 11 months. Last I knew annual was 12 months. Then when I called the automated line I owed no payment for ****** Now she's telling me I have to pay by 4 ******* not to recieve a late fee. I asked to speak to a supervisor first girl lied and told me they were on break 2nd one **** said there is no supervisor. What a racket. I paid mine off and they still are trying to charge me. Why when I paid it off and called for the pay off wasn't told about the ***** annual fee. Your customer service is horrible. I will be filing a complaint with the bbb
"If I could keep this company zero stars I would I I call this company ask them how how much would I have to pay them to pay them off the person that I talk to told me and I did in about two weeks later they sent me a email or text up saying that I still owe them over $900 and every time I do a dispute with them they change the numbers around on my account trying to justify that money that they say are all them because when I talk to the representative I asked her are you sure I dont owe you guys any more money and the person told me no no maam that was September 30, 2016 "
"I dont even want to give them one star.I got my monthly statement, and paid the bill in full.  It posted days before it was due.  They sent me another statement that I owed $11.34 on interest of purchase.I told them I already paid that in full, and didnt use the card the whole next month.They keep telling me its a late fee.  *** argued a million times that it posted days before the due date on the statement, how can they say it is late.******* is still happening.I wouldnt recommend this credit card to my worst enemy.  They keep robbing you small amounts of money each month!"
"I would not recommend this company. They blocked my credit card for no apparent reason and are making me go through hoops and f****** holes to get it unblocked. I sent them all the necessary documentation, but they are now saying that it is not sufficient and they cannot accept it because I won't let them see what's in my personal bank account or my personal checking account number. They are full of ****, and they charge you a ton of fees. "
"This credit card company is a scam. They do not take automated payments. I have tried to pay the 3 times without any success. They do not accept computerized payments I have tried to pay through an agent. Today at 11:30 am the money is not deducted from my account. If they do not take the money today, I will stop trying to pay them. I will leave a note at the credit reporting agency that it is impossible to pay them. Stay away from this credit card company. BBB I can not believe they have a triple-A rating with you. This has to change immediately."
"*****, I would like to start right off by saying from my experience with this company, the person(s) who said I was approved for a loan is a sure fraud.  They are bogus, and true scammers.  But let me tell you why, and by the way I wrote a review on March 7, 2023 and for some reasons cannot find it.  Needless to say, I went online and thought I was approved by a legitimate company.  When I was asked to do certain things, my mind was saying loud and clear that this is a scam.  A woman named *********************** called me and said I was approved for a 2K loan to be paid monthly of ***** for 12 months.  She asked me for my banking information, and said it was for a verification process.  Stupid me, knowing you never give your info out to anyone, but I did.  She told me her account manager would be calling me back with specific instructions.  A man named ***************** who could not spell his last name called me.  ****** was put into my checking account, and I was surprised.  **** called me and asked me to get a wal-mart silver money card for ******, but do not tell wal-mart it is for avant. I did it anyway, and called him back with the infor on the card then he asked me to send a pix of the receipt and card.  I did, and he said it was for verification.  He said the 2k would be in my account in 3 hours.  No show!!  He called me on Monday morning and asked if I checked my account, and I did,  He had already taken out the balance of the 490, and made my account negative ******.  He said my account will be negative ****** and when I send the ****** back to him, I will get the 2k.  I realized it was a scam!!!  My bank called me on Monday also, and told me my account was negative ******, and I was scammed by avant.  I closed my acct. He called me back and demanded that I finished the transaction. They have a website phone # and address, but they are the best scammers. RUN.. I hate scammers, these ppl are really good at scamming!!! RUN!!"
This avant robbed me by charging me over 400$ on a credit card I used one time then lost card.
If I could give them negative starts I absolutely would!!!! They are horrible I had to order a new card twice now and have still not received it! The 1st time I reordered it they said I had to wait 5 weeks so I did and still nothing! The 2nd time I re ordered it I had moved so I had it sent to my new address and the stupid person who put in the order never updated my address and I just waited another 5 weeks for no reason !!!! Now they are refusing to overnight my card and I have to close my account and mess up my credit because I have had an open account but no card so no way to use it !!!!! Horrible customer service and ethics I wouldnt be surprised if the whole company is just a bunch of scammers!!!!
"I had a loan with Avant and paid it off early. It was a great experience from application to payoff. So, when the time came for me get another loan, Avant was the first loan company to come to mind. However, THIS TIME MY EXPERIENCE WAS AWFUL!!!!!  First, it took a week for them to look at my documents. I had provided pay stubs, annual pay going back 15 years, and additional income. When the called they 2021 tax docs. I sent that directly fom tax website. They called two days later stating it didn't have a cover page! What! Nothing wss missing! So I sent tax transcript form IRS. Someone called the next asking for items ALREADY UPLOADED and questions ASKED THE *** BEFORE! I asked them why all the ********************* when NOTHING HAD CHANGED FROM THE LAST LOAN! I was so upset! It's two weeks now! So, they said I will hear from them 24 hrs. So 24 hrs - NO CALL!  INSTEAD I GET AN EMAIL STATING MY LOAN APPLICATION HAS EXPIRED!!! When I called to ask HOW CAN MY APPLICATION EXPIRE WHEN YOU HAD ALL DOCUMENTS AND CALLED PRACTICALLY EVERY*** FOR THE SAME DOCS AGAIN EXCEPT FOR THE *** YOU WERE SUPPOSE TO CALL EITH LOAN RESULTS!!! AVANT'S ANSWER ""WE HAVE NO CONTROL OVER THE SYSTEM AND I HAVE APPLY AGAIN""!!!!! So I asked for a manager. I waited 12 minutes and was told that a manager will call back. I AM STILL WAITING FOR THAT CALL BACK!!!! SCAM!!!!!!"
"If I could give a negative review, I definitely would.  I only used this credit csrd.for Christmas and paid it off completely the following month for the lat couple of years. In Mid January of 2023 I did the usual and paid it ""in full"". On 1/31/23 payment was applied to my account.  Then on 2/17/23 I was charged additional interest.  I have called customer service twice and they refuse to reverse the interest charge  I have even asked to speak to a billingamer on 2/23/23 and was told NO that I had to pay the interest charge and would be sent back the remaining amount of my annual fee. How does someone accure interest on an account that has been paid in full? They told me I was on a recorded line so I stated the date and time of 2/24/34 @ 8;36 am and demanded my account to be closed. Worst company ever!!! "
"DO NOT DO IT! Their system glitched multiple times causing my bank to reject my complete balance payment. I called my bank after contacting Avant and was told by my bank it was an error on Avantss part. When I tried to make my avants account complete balance payment again, I received an error message. Avants ************ me to make 3 separate payments over the coarse of 3 days but the third payment would not go through until I called them again. After all of this, I was charged a late fee and interest because their system was broken. When I call to ask why I was charged these fees, the customer service was rude and hung up in my face when I ask why I have to pay for your broken system.?"
Poor customer service. Do not sign up for this card . Fees not worth it
severely lacking in several areas especially customer support. i was hacked several times with this card only!!
"I wouldnt recommend this company. I applied for a small loan, and during my application process, I uploaded all requested documents the same day on the portal. After uploading the documents, I received a green boxing stating completed. Everyday after I would either receive an email that said please call AVANT or upload a document in which I had already upload. This went on for 6 days, each day I would call and speak to different representatives, informing them all that I had completed those task. They would confirm with me that was accurate and told me we will process your application and approval could can taken place within the same 24hrs. This was my same scenario every day for 6 days. On day 7, I received an email stating that my application had expired and I would have to re-apply. In disbelief I contacted Avant and the representative pretty much read my email to me, before I could even speak to tell her why I was calling. I informed her I would like to know why they dropped they ball? Why did they send the same emails to me daily with task I had already completed. When I asked for a supervisor, I was told they were on the phone with someone else and the representative would schedule a call back for the supervisor to call me That call back never happened. Please dont waste your time with this company, please dont give them your personal information and then receive a soft or hard pull on your credit. They acted as amateurs or a scamming company."
"DO NOT do business with these people! I made one payment and then couldnt access my account through browser or app. When I called to find out what was going on, they hung up on me 3 times! Each time I called back and explained my problem to them. After someone finally kept me on the line, listened to my problems and then took my payment, she told me Id be contacted via email to fix my login issue. This was January 2. I just received an email yesterday regarding this. If I emailed this company about my issue they would reply saying they could not locate my account. I called to close my account today and they couldnt find me at all this time. I waited an hour, called back and she had no problem locating my account, closing it and hanging up on me. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER AND WORST CC CARD COMPANY EVER! Dont trust every recommendation Credit Karma offers you. "
"Do NOT get a credit card with this company.  It is a predatory bank who tries to force you to pay fees/interest when not owed then threatens to show you delinquent on your credit report.  I paid my account off in Novemeber and told the representative to close the account.  A few days later I receive a bill for $4 interest and then a LATE fee of $37 on the interest.  I called to tell them I am not paying either charges, I closed this account.   Their representatives work from home, and hang up, lie, and today I received another statement owing $112 - all LATE FEES AND INTEREST ON THE LATE FEES.    I called again today and supposely got an email address - it does not send.   I am contacting the ****************** and the **************** of the ******** General to fil a complain against this scheme to extort money from people by threatening to ruin your credit.  "
"This company is horrible. There was a fraudulent charge that appeared on my account from a Casino while I was vacationing in *****.  I became concerned about their cybersecurity since my card was used by someone else. They still required me to divulge my personal information before discussing the issue. Considering the breach, I believe they have very poor policies in place to handle harmful customer events. More fraudulent charges appeared after that. I spent my valuable time over more than one thirty minute call reporting these charges and Avant failed to remove them from the account through the dispute process. They are not a bank. They are AWFUL at handling customers. They even had the audacity to drop my credit limit with a note in the account that the customer was being rude or some such. This was later reversed in a tacit acknowledgement of their error. The complete ordeal was a massive waste of time and I ended up paying for someone elses Pizza (twice) just to close the account to prevent further breaches, wasted time, and disrespectful treatment. Their process is slow. Even after the final payment was posted they still prattled on about trying to collect a debt. Their incompetence is astonishing. I attempted to resolve the issue with their leaders by reaching out, but was ignored. Honestly, a terrible company. Would not recommend them to anyone. "
"I have had my Avant credit card for seven billing cycles. Each billing cycle I receive a digital statement via the app informing me of the minimum amount due and the due date. Without fail, I will authorize payment for double the minimum due within 10 days of receiving the statement.On December 17th, 2022 I checked the app and my statement had been generated. It showed the minimum balance due ($25) and the due date (January 13th, 2023). On that day (December 17th) I made a payment of $50. The payment was accepted and the funds were withdrawn from my checking account on December 20th, 2022.On January 14th, I was charged a $25 late fee for missing the due date of January 13th. When I called to find out what happened, I was informed that since I made my payment on the last day of my billing cycle, it did not count toward the January 13th due date. When I asked to speak to a supervisor, I was disconnected. Upon calling back, the second representative told me the same thing. Instead of working with me, both representatives argued with me insisting that it was my fault and that it would not be rectified. A ""request"" to reverse the late charge was processed and was denied.I have received 7 statements from Avant and I have bank records showing 7 payments for double my minimum within a few days of receiving each statement. This means I have NEVER missed a payment and have always been at least two weeks early. Yet since my most recent payment occurred the *** I received my statement, Avant claims it only goes toward the balance and does not satisfy the minimum due.Everyone I spoke to at Avant refused to help me. Both my emails went unanswered. When I received the email informing me that my request for a late fee reversal was denied, I immediately called Avant and closed my account. What kind of ****ed-up company refuses to help its customers? It's apparent that Avant is taking advantage of those of us with bad credit and we REALLY need to put them out of business."
"Pulled my credit, (hard inquiry) and said I was approved (not prequalified). Then gave the monthly amount and APR terms for repayment. I Provided all documentation and multiple check stubs that were uploaded directly from my company payroll/employer. Before sending the final contract for me to sign, they updated my account to say that theyre unable to verify my income and Im now denied. I am a nurse with a W2 legitimate job with proof of sufficient income via pay stubs AND bank statements but you cannot verify??? SOMETHING IS NOT RIGHT HERE. "
"This is one company you don't want to deal with, they are a rip off, you make a payment and the next month you owe more than you did the month before,  believe me, stay away from Avant"
"I was approved for a credit card on 11/21/22. The card never arrived. They would not help me with this issue via email so after calling three different times, because of long wait times, I finally talked to someone on 12/24/22 and they said they would have to reissue a card to me. Interestingly enough, I did some research online and found that there were many costumers reporting in December that Avant told them their was a glitch in the system. They didn't tell me and let me think it was somehow my fault. It is now 1/13/23, they are reporting this account to all major credit bureaus and I don't even have a card!? At least give me a virtual one while you get this figured out!? Definitely regret choosing them over a competitor!"
"Avant, is awful compared to other credit cards in terms of refunding their excessive ***** late payment fees. I was late making a two payments, and both times I called to explain the circumstances, and both times I was denied..When you call they make it sound like your going to get the fee removed. They say"" ********** ***************, we have accepted your request for a refund of these late fees. In two weeks you  will receive a decision""., ********** I was denied.Most other credit cards I have dealt with, are willing to remove the first or even second time, and they have the ability to do it over the phone, rather than making you wait 2 weeks. Just paid the card off and canceled my account. Garbage card and garbage company."
"I got approved for a small credit card almost a year ago I use the online app to make payments. My card was reported lost in nov 2022 the 1st rep stated 7 to 10 business days for a new card. She also stated the card would be deactivated Understanding mail can be slow due to holidays I waited on Dec 17th I called again I made a payment and the rep told me she would send the card out again  and it would take 7 to 15 days.  This rep claimed to be a supervisor because I asked to speak with one Its now Jan 3, 2022 I spoke with a rep today first she said due to the weather my card was late, then she said a vendor is the reason the card was late and it can take up to 5 weeks meanwhile I have small bills coming off of this card I asked to speak to a supervisor she put me on hold then came back as usual no supervisor is available! This is how it is EVERYTIME i call. furthermore I was told when opening a credit card making on time payments for 6 months I can get credit increase this is not true. Instead of waiting for an imaginary card, pouring my money into something I will not benefit to build credit with this company I cant get help or answers when I need it! I just want to know when I pay off this small balance and close my card how long will that take? How will it affect my score? Do they do balance transfers? I guess with this company you gotta take your chances. I will pay off and cancel! The company always says escalating the issue but never no resolution. "
"I was pre approved for a loan. They ask for way to much information. They asked for bank information, ******** stubs for them still to decide if you get the loan and I was DENIED. They took way too long to give the decision."
It came to my knowledge that an account had been started in my name with this bank whom I have never done business with or heard of until now. I went through the normal fraud process but when I asked how they obtain my information I received inaccurate information. I have followed up a few times now and have yet to receive a response. I have contacted the attorney generals office. If they are doing this to me and I am not even an customer of theirs I could only imagine what they are doing to their customers.
I've had this credit card for awhile.  To update my background I haven't had a late payment in probably 10 years. They set my payment on the 13th of the month. I get paid on the 3rd wednesday  of each month.  They refuse to change my due date. They tell me they are reporting  this to the credit beauro. They are the only company that won't work with me. 
"This company is a total scam!!!  I was approved for a credit card with a $2,000 limit and a $58 annual fee.  I was ok with the annual fee since I am rebuilding my credit after a divorce.  I paid my annual fee and wanted to start using my card.  The problem was every time I tried to use the card they denied the transaction and froze my account!!!  I spent several hours on the phone with their rude customer service department.  Each time I spoke with them they assured me the problem was taken care of.  WELL...... today I received an email telling me they closed my account due to inconsistent account information!!!!  The only inconsistent information was from their own company!!!    BEWARE!!!!!  Do not deal with them!  You will not be able to use your credit card and then in the end you will lose your annual fee!!!!!  HORRIBLE COMPANY!!!!!!!!!"
Dealing with customer service is hard. It appears to be overseas and u get dismissed and the run around. I have really good credit and while in the hospital (major surgery 22 staples) my wallet was stolen. It was a mess cleaning up all the fraud. ** of my good payment history I was able to fix what was out of the norm with all other lenders. Avant is the only company that is not willing to help . They say theyre in the business of helping consumers but theyre not really. My account has since been paid in full and closed. I would advise u to go thru *********** or a credit union. STAY AWAY. Avant will only hurt your credit. It dropped mines 41 point 
Avant refused to honor my early payment to be applied to my account and said I still owed more money even though I paid well before the due date. I tried to file several late fee waivers but they all were denied. They claimed that because I had paid before the statement date they couldn't fix my account. They dinged my credit by 24 points and kept calling me to make a payment. I had to close my account because the manager ***** refused to work with me and reconcile my account. This company is a scam! They will take your money and still say you were late and ruin your credit score!
Do not use this Company! Pay my balance off every month. They charged my card $3.49 the month of no balance. Did not bother inform me of this charge. Tried to use the card and it declined. Called customer service and argued the fact they never sent a bill. They made me out to be a liar and I needed to pay my bills. **** never recommend this company to Anyone!
"Their customer service is rude and nasty.  If they hate their job so much, they should go out and find one they like.  Instead of taking it out on the customer."
**************  went into my bank account without proper authentication.  Closed the account.  Wished I had checked here first 
"-1, this is the worst company ever. They will give you a credit limit in 3 months take it down, and report you as overthelimit. I was always on Time, and before time with payments. It took my credit score down 78 points. Run away"
"Been waiting on my card for 2 month customer service, and supervisors. Keep hanging up on me and giving me the runaround. Im at the point after waiting two months to get my card I am closing my account. This is not a credit card company I would recommend to anyone."
The worst company to deal with! Terrible customer service! Not worth any ***** to have this credit Card. I was out of work at one point and they charged fees on top of fees and not one of them are willing to work with you. Horrible horrible company!! 
"I've had problems with this card that, ultimately, drove me to close the account before I paid my balance back in full. The last straw for me was them refusing to put an $80 payment in my ""Available Credit"" with the claimit had already been placed in my account. IT WAS NOT! My balance at the start of the month was $340. I paid them $80, spent $83, expecting the next $80 to be placed back on the card. They tell me that it takes ************************************* my Available Credit, which is very odd, in the first place (no other card I have does this). I paid them on the 3rd of Nov 2022, Since the 10th day this month came on a Sunday (not a business day), the payment never showed up. However, it did not come the following day either. I called the company, and the rep said that the $80 would be reflected in my Available Credit by the end of Nov 14. I accepted. The money never came. I called them again, and another rep tells me that the money was already placed on my card on the 3rd, which is a lie because my Available Credit NEVER reflected $80 being placed on it. This rep kept repeating that the payment ""posted"" on the 3rd, yet I tell her it never showed up in my Available Credit. She repeats the lie that it was available on the same day the payment posted. I tried explaining to her that the Available Credit never reflected the payment, and she soon hung up on me. I had issues with the company before, from them rejecting my bank account due to problems on thier site, to my purchases being flagged as fraudulent by thier automated system. I don't know if I've done the process right, but I immediately closed my account after realizing that they were going to continue to lie about the $80 that never showed up in my Available Credit. I'll pay what I oweThe company and its reps have always had a hint of negligence regarding me as customer. It all started with them rejecting a plentiful payment source they'd taken from, and it went down from there. "
"Randomly logged onto the site to make an additional payment. I owed approximately $300 total of $1400 limit.  I login to see my credit limit was dropped to $500. So now the credit utilization of that card is astronomical. Never late on payments, auto-pay is enabled on all of my credit cards.Called support, they asked if I received a notice on October 20, 2022, I don't recall receiving one or I figured it was a random misent statement (electronic delivery), and with auto-pay on I don't read them.I am paying off this card and closing my account. I don't need the additional credit utilization from this card as I have multiple cards with zero balances.I strongly suggest anyone that has this card to close it, or anyone looking to get this card to help your credit to not do so. This massive drop in available credit will hurt a lot of people if it is a standard practice for this company."
"AVANT Is a joke!!  The started me out with a $1500 credit limit. And I thought this was great, but several times I attempted to use the card and it was declined, but then it woul be fine.  I was never late and even paid the card off and had a zero balance.  I went to check the card and they dropped my credit limit by $1200 with no explanation and I made a decision to just close the account.  AVANT WILL NEVER have to worry about me!"
They charge fees on top of fees. Ive been transferred to 3 people. I had to start all over with my complaint. Do not use AVANT for anything! 
"We need to file a class action lawsuit .  They opened my account for ****,  I challenged the fact that they took a 253 payment twice,  I complained to a supervisor. To retaliate they lowered my limit to 300 which lowered my credit limit. My score is 743.  They lied to lower my score. Stay away from Avant!!"
"I had a $1,500 credit offer which I accepted and after only 3 months of using the credit card, paying my bills on time, and never being over the credit limit they dropped my limit without notice to $300. Looking at other complaints this is apparently a pretty common thing with this company. Damaging my credit for being a good customer is disgusting. Avoid this company, I don't know what their angle is in signing people up and then damaging their credit but it is a horrible practice."
"The only reason Im giving them 2 stars is because of the nice credit limit they initially gave me. Less than a month ago this company lowered my credit limit by $2,700 without any warning. When I called asking why all they would say is that a letter was mailed out to my physical address and I should received it in **** business days. That was over 20 days ago and I have received nothing. If that wasnt enough of a red flag, looking through the app reviews, I noticed numerous complaints of them lowering credit limits all around the same time as mine happened. I had no late payments on my account according to my apps Home Screen. I only used it once for a purchase and paid it right off. I was saving it to purchase a vacation package. Now that idea is ruined. They responded to my complaint on the app asking me to call them. They refused to converse via email, and I work 12 out of 14 days so I dont have time to sit on the phone and argue with them. I want my original credit limit back, or I want them to refund the annual fee and close the account. This company has to be a scam given what Ive seen. "
"By reading the other consumer reviews, it appears my complaint is very common. Ive had Avant for over 2yrs and have been on time with my monthly payments and have even, on numerous occasions, sent lump sums to ensure I stayed under the 30% utilization rate. All of this for them to decrease my credit limit from $1000 to $300. This dropped my credit score tremendously!! I barely even used the card. I only got it to increase my credit score. I will be paying it in full and I will never use it. I think there should be a class action suit against Avant. I will definitely be looking into it. "
"They pre-approved me for a $2000 credit limit, with no affect to my credit score. I accepted because it was a good starting limit (I had plenty of established credit in good standing) only after they approved me and I accepted did they pull credit (a hard inquiry, which hurts your credit) I used the card once and then paid it off that month. Now I've had the card for 4 months, and without reason or warning they reduce my credit to $300 they site several excuses, all of which were exactly the same as when I accepted the offer, except that my score had increased. I would have NEVER allowed someone to pull my credit for a credit card with a $ 300 limit. Now I see all of the other reviews stating the exact same thing They need to be reported to the **** for deceptive credit practices. And I'm just the girl to do it! DO NOT TRUST THESE SCAMMERS."
"I applied for a credit card almost a year ago, and was approved. I received the credit card in the mail, however when I tried to activate the card I received an error message. I contact their support team and was advised that no account existed on my name. Which didnt make sense since I could log on to an online account. I was told to wait a few days and try again. I did that but still couldnt activate the card. Each time I call I receive a different answer and have never received a return call or email from their supposed escalations team. Ive emailed and called over the last year and have not received any assistance. This card is reporting on my credit and I cant even use it. Even now when I try to log on it says there was a technical problem and its been that way for months. I just want this card removed from my credit profile seeing as I cant even access the funds. "
"Opened a card with a $1000 limit. Paid all payments on time, no past due amount, no partial payments, never over the credit limit- then get a letter stating that because of length of time this account has been established , payment percentage of amount due, and  over limit activity- huh? My credit limit is cut $250  What a joke, makes zero sense- and good luck getting anyone to tell you anything helpful on the phone- thanks avant, for wrecking my credit utilization "
The customer service is the worst by far!!! This company does not care for their customers nor do they care to resolve any issues. I will not recommend doing any business with them you will regret it
"I guess I am in the same boat. They pursued me. Then I finally accepted a $2000 credit limit. The only thing I bought was tickets to Broadway. I logged in to pay it off. Just to see they had lowered my limit.  I imagine they will lower it again when I pay it off.  I wanted to be able to use, just to have a major card, at a hotel. Now the limit has been lowered to $500.  Stuck with play tickets now, I am scrambling to find a reasonable hotel that takes debit cards without holding up all my money. One of the reasons listed for the drop in credit was ""Frequency of overlimit activity"" when I have only used 23% of my credit; nowhere near over the limit."
"This company is a fraud. They have violated the Americans with Disabilities Act, The Fair Credit Reporting Act, and are routinely rude and incompetent in handling any customer service requests. DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH AVANT. "
Im now concerned rather to use the BBB when reviewing a business because they are clearly misleading. How could this horrible company have an A rating. Avant Sent offers daily - I didnt need their credit but after a year of daily mail from them I accepted their card with a $3000 limit - just for them to lower the limit to $750 less than five months later. Their customer service is worthless and lie to you because they are clueless. I had autopay set up and made extra payments throughout the month if I used this very high interest card. Not once was I late and am grateful I didnt owe too much to pay them off. Will definitely cut this card up. Not sure who Im more disappointed with - Avant LLC or the BBB for giving them a A rating. Wouldnt have taken the offer in the first place. 
"This company tugs you around. I was preapproved for a loan so I filled out their application. A few days go by and they finally ask me to upload documents to support my loan, I do, a few more days go by they want a phone call, I do. They said go on and upload a few more documents , I did, then another phone call telling to me upload a few more, I do that. Then the application automatically expires after 7 days even after they said its in review and they will get to it when they get to it. Well a day after the last time they had me upload more personal information my application expired. They told me that I can reapply on their website. I went to reapply and now it says I dont qualify on the prequal form and there isnt any way to resume my current application. A bunch of wasted time and hard credit pull. Company needs to get their act together "
This is completely a scam and based on other reviews it is compounded.. Opened this card in June with a higher limit made all payments on time. Paid it down to a little over a $100. So what do they do without warning drop your credit limit down to $300.. Is this looks like you're maxing out your cards instantly.. They should be sued..  This is not only immoral and unfair but it should be if not illegal.
"This company have you sign up for one credit amount and gives you something Entirely different , with no reason why. When you receive your card. New card Mess up your debt ratio Beware!!"
"Had $1,000 starting credit line. Never missed a payment. Balance was $0 paid off. Lowered my credit line to $300 after one month of not using it at all. Absolutely stupid. Closed account, will get a card elsewhere. "
"Started out great, $3000 credit limit, I made my payments regularly and used my card all the time. Last week I went to use my card, it was declined. Logged into my account, which had $150ish of charges, and a $300 limit. No late fees no over drafts. I emailed the company, they told me to call, so I called. I was hung up on 2 times before I finally got a supervisor, **** I think. I was told that they could not tell me why my limit was reduced and there was nothing I could do but wait for the letter explaining the decrease. I then ask to close my account due to poor customer service and the lack of Why. Supervisor was angry that I was complaining and in no way cared about customer service. Do not use this company."
This business is a circus ??.They have an app to make payments that does not work. You call to make payments and they cancel them to hit you with late fees and hit your credit report. A complete scam. Called this past week employee said she had my information the started reading off an incorrect name of a man in ******* when I'm in *************. Hopefully the government will shut them down. Nothing but hurting people for $$
"soon as possible i will close this account! the day before i left for vacation they decreased my line of credit to near nothing, no warning, all payments were made on time. calling them is useless, i got nowhere. no help, was told they will be sending me info on why this happened via mail within 7to 10 days? i hope these people get shut down."
"Do not get this card if you are trying to improve your credit. I received the card in July 2022 with a **** limit. I never paid it late (before the due date)and I always paid more than the minimum payment. If i made a purchase , I was logging on and making a payment. Well , logged on and saw where they dropped my available credit to ****. By doing this , I look like I am maxiing out the card and this type of shenanigan is what wrecks your credit. I owe 197 , will pay that and never use the card again!!!!!"
"I would've given Avant a ZERO rating.  DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY! I attempted a ""balance transfer"" from Avant LLC to a much lower interest rate credit card.  The very first thing the Avant Rep said, ""not a problem"".  She began to recite the requirements; Avant requires the account to be in good standing, the credit card accepting the balance transfer must have a lower interest rate than Avant.  No problem my account is in good standing and the credit card accepting the transfer has a much lower interest rate than Avant.  The rep placed me on hold for 10 minutes.  When she returned, she stated that Avant does not do balance transfers however they accept balance transfers from other credit card companies. I informed her that the information she provided was NOT in my contract agreement with Avant.  I requested for the information to be mailed or emailed to me and she said that couldn't because its Avant's internal policy.  I requested to speak to a supervisor. After waiting 20 minutes, supervisor repeated the same as the rep. **** is deceptive practices. **** is NOT in my printed contractual agreement with Avant.  The call was monitored and recorded by Avant and me for future reference.  Hard to believe they have an ""A"" rating with the BBB."
"I would give negative stars if I could. This card has TERRIBLE customer service. They sent an email offering help to those of us hit by Hurricane ***, in the form of no late fees. I called to confirm this and ask to skip the payment for October, to which the agent said I could. I skip the payment and am immediately inundated with late payment emails. I call again and the first person I spoke to told me I hadnt made my August payment and that was why I was getting the emails. I made two payments in July, one on the first for July and one on the 29th for August. Then, when I got a supervisor on the phone, he told me my September AND October payments were late and I told him I was looking at my statements and September was paid on the 3rd. He refused to uphold what the agent that had told me about being able to skip the payment. Thanks for not assessing late fees, but no thanks for the late payment **** on my credit score. I will pay this garbage card off as soon as I can and get rid of it. Stay away from Avant!!"
"They sent me in the mail offer $3,000. Credit and approved me July 2022 once their numbers up for investors to look good maybe?  They then mid October 2022 decrease my credit limit to $300.  I dont need another low amount credit card.  I havent missed a payment or anything.  Low balance on my card.  False pretenses to obtain customers. "
Do not go through this company for any reason.  They will give you the wrong information to send payoff amounts and then you have to go through hoops to make sure you find the right address to pay off your debt.  **************** ***** and they will hang up on you MULTIPLE TIMES for no reason!  I hope this company gets shut down!!! They do not seem legit at all.
They closed my account locked it and two weeks later after being told to contact idtheft@ avant.com  no response no answer to why they closed it it certainly is no legitimate reason besides the fact they scammers because I paid all my payments on time and got a credit card increase in less than 6 months its really weird never in all my years have I experienced such poor communication and customer support 
"I opened my credit card statement to find over $400 in fraudulent charges. Avant adviser me I would be assigned a case number and a worker within ********************************** Upon calling the Case worker (over 50 times), I consistently get voice mail which states my calls will be returned with 24 hours. Not once have I received a return call. I am now in the process of finding an attorney to handle this for me."
"  Why you might ask has Avant sent me an email asking for a review on ""Trustpilot"", I do not do business with this company or one of their other companies commonly known as ""Fingerhut"". Avant is ********* They both have had fraudulent accounts on my ""credit report"" for years, and now they want me to give a review on ""Trustpilot"", needless to say they have disabled the review page after I sent the customer support team this e-mail - Why would you ask me to give Trustpilot a review on you? I do not do business with you, I do not understand? Of course they have not answered my e-mail. You can not even imagine how many times I have disputed this on my report, please won't someone help me remove these 2 accounts from my credit report as are not mine they weren't ever mine! **** F"
"SCAM!!! I applied for a loan a week ago submitted all requested documents and was told that my application was being processed/reviewed and checked my Avant account today to find out that my application had expired and in order for Avant to continue to review my application I have to reapply smh.. THIS COMPANY SHOULD BE SHUT DOWN FOR FRAUD THEY ARE CROOKS, 24 HOUR PROCESSING IS A JOKE THEY ARE COLLECTING PEOPLES INFORMATION TO SELL ON THE BLACK MARKET, STAY AWAY FROM THESE CROOKS..."
"Avant is horrible! I never signed up for a credit card with them. I never received a credit card. I never spent even a ***** using ************************** am in debt over $300 because they charged me for apparent monthly fees. They sent my account to collections without my knowledge. Ruined my credit score. Avants customer service is complete garbage. I tried so many times to get my account in good standing. Ive emailed multiple times & called their customer service line. I received no *********** actually hung up on me every time I told them about my situation. Ive never used any of their services. Avant is a money hungry credit card company preying on individuals to open an account. Please do NOT open an account with Avant. Thank me later. **************** They will not reply to your emails, EVER! Customer service is non existent. ******************** IS A FRAUDULENT COMPANY! Ruined my credit score without my knowledge. "
"Worst **************** ever. Nobody ever understands you. Scam Artists Avant put a $250 charge on my card & trying to tell me I did it. I barely use this card, only for gas. They keep acting like I made the purchase (JOKE) every other day its some big breach."
**************** is very bad!! I've been calling for for the past 3 days!!! Been laughed at. been told to hold for 2 mins about 20 times. No *** contact!!!!!! DO NOT GET THIS CARD!!!
"If I could give zero stars I would. I rarely use this card, but put a couple of purchases on it in May because using credit is supposed to increase my credit score (total scam btw). In June, I paid the balance off. Two weeks later, I get an email that I've missed a payment, so I paid the new balance, and figured I'd just leave the overpayment to go towards my streaming service. They still cannot find my June payment, even though it cleared my bank two days later.  I have called them 4 times and emailed them proof of payment TWICE. Twice I was told that my issue would be 'escalated' and someone would contact me.Today I got a auto-email that said 'It looks like we assisted you over the phone.' THEY HAVE NOT. As soon as I can get these idiots to acknowledge their error and credit my account, I'm closing it. STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY!! "
"Avant is sketchy to say the least. Upon opening an account- their website looks totally normal and like a legitimate bank. Plenty of information, content, all the right menu options, perks, services, security, etc. Once approved, their app, at face value, appears completely normal as well, containing all of the right verbiage and visuals to make you not think twice about their legitimacy.  However, when you see fraudulant charges on your statement and attempt to handle the situation, it becomes very clear that this is NOT your average credit card company.Their ""lock your card from your app, instantly"" is a lie. When you click the button to do so, it provides you a phone number. No matter what resource you're looking for on your account, all buttons direct you back to a phone number. When calling it becomes even more clear this is some kind of back ***** operation and is completely suspicious. The hold music is out of a horror movie and ive learned Avant truly doesnt have any real employees or departments. They have a call center of people who answer for several companies just like Avant and then will transfer you to another ""department"" where the person answering is also not employed by Avant. Just a completely suspect operation all together. Really makes you question things. We're so worried about protecting our information and money yet blindly give it to companies like this who are making a killing taking advantage of our sense of security with banks yet I cant help but question if companies like Avant are the ones we should fear. I would be SHOCKED if I got my money back on the 7 fraudulent transactions.The my card was used more than 600 miles away from anywhere I have ever used my card yet I received no warning emails, calls, texts, etc. and my card was not frozen. It has taken me 2 weeks to get in touch with anyone in the fraud ""department"" and even that was a completely weird process/conversation.I absolutely would not recommend this company. "
This has been the worst process ever! I read all these good reviews about this company  and thought well I will give them a try! Worst mistake and waste of my time! I applied for a personal loan 3xs I provided everything that they need and asked for called multiple times asking for update nobody could give me one! They let the application expired 3x with out granting a decision and just left me on read. The way I have been treated has been terrible! I have reached out to customer service via email and phone and still no response. I cant believe that this company treats potential clients like this! I never received a denial or approval but yet they have all my information. If giving no stars was an option I wouldnt even give them this one! Just terrible terrible business practices! 
"This company has the worst communication ever. I applied for $25k loan on 8/1/22 this is my 2nd loan with Avant my previous loan was paid in full. I did not receive verbal or written notification when additional documents were requested. I would only find out about my loan status when I would log onto my online account. Requested documents were submitted within the same day. Several representatives confirmed that a decision would be made in 3 days and then changed to 7 days. It is now the 8th day and no decision. Oh the rhetorical questions drove me up the wall. Simple verification does not take more than 3 days to approve the loan. Not sure what the hold up is since I was already pre-approved. I requested corporates phone number,  the customer service rep stated she was not at discretion to give out. The *** ******* Bochener needs to send his employees through a customer service etiquette training. "
For the first time I received a **** from this company that I never heard of. There was no charges  but they did try to charge me $600 for nothing but on this statement it states that my credit limit is $300.I called them to file fraudulent billing when I never heard of this card before.They said they will followup.Be very careful and don't fall for any nonsense.
"I was approved for a $3,000 credit limit and got my card over a month ago. I have tried to use it a handful of times, and it was declined every time. I have tried to call the customer service #. They just keep telling me that they are aware of the issue and are working on it, and I will get an email when the issue is resolved ...It's been almost 5 weeks, no email and I still can't use the card. This company is terrible to say the least!!! Do not get this card!"
"Poor communication, charges out of nowhere, and if you haven't paid before the due date, they spam your telephone number with calls every hour from multiple numbers. AVOID THIS COMPANY "
"This is the second time I just visited AVANT, LLC website to check out Personal Loans interest rates and how much I could borrow to consolidate credit card debt. I did several years ago borrow $2,000 and paid the loan off in full without missing a payment. I wanted to use them again but like I said, this was the second time I just visited their website. AND this the second time I was declined a LOAN I NEVER APPLIED FOR sending me an email with a  letter of NOAA (Notice of ADVERSE Action).  Please explain how this company is still in business. HOW DO YOU DECLINE A LOAN THAT WAS NEVR APPLIED FOR?  Please stay away from this company they will ruin your credit."
"I pay my balance off in full every month and have all my auto payments set up on this card. I received a fraud alert from Avant regarding a **** payment. I called and informed them it was not fraud and they stated my card should be working fine. Every transaction there after has been declined. Ive called over 10 times and I keep getting different answers. I typed my card information incorrectly, its a merchant problem, etc. According to Avant, its everyone elses fault that my card will not work. Its been three weeks and at this point any time i call, the representative hangs up on me after I verify my identity like clockwork. I did some googling and, according to the internet, there was some kind of massive data breach. Instead of informing and apologizing to their customers, the shut off everyones cards. At this point Ive been charged countless late fees on accounts that are set up to be paid from this account. Ive never seen such dishonestly, unprofessionalism, or incompetence from a business, let alone a financial institution."
"    I bought a  $557.28 tool from ************** using my Avant credit card. Returned the tool to ************** in September of 2021. The entire return transaction was fully documented.    ************** clerk asked if I wanted cash back or the return funds credited back to my Avant credit card. I said ""just credit it back to my card"".To this day Avant LLC refuses to credit the $557.28 back to my account. I have called and emailed.Avant LLC will not return my call and refuses to credit my account in spite of the clear fact that the entire return transaction has been fully documented by the ********* ************** **** Depot store.Avant LLC are dishonest, crooks. Do not do business with them. As of now they have stolen $557.28 from me. Crooks!!! "
I applied on a Sunday submitted all my information was advised in 24 hrs you will get a response. Two days go by nothing I send an email was told wait ***** business hrs I did nothing called them was told you have to wait I did nothing come Sunday 7 days later I was told my application was closed because I failed to submit docs in which I did website confirmed and an email with a rep confirmed. I spoke to 4 different people who refused to get a manager told me there is no credit team available or applications team to re apply so I said ok here we are round 2 same c*** as the first time I called the office again same s*** and the rep was on repeat I asked for help she said you have to wait asked for a rep in ******* was told no asked for a manger was told they are busy and cant take ur call 
"There was an unauthorized debit card payment taken from my checking account on two occasions with the vendor Avant on 06/15/22 and on 07/15/22. I did not authorize two payments in the amount of $100 each from my account. I received an email for each transaction which let me know that the payment was coming out.  Because I am very good with paying my bills on time, I thought maybe for the June payment I had set up the payment on an earlier date and just forgot. I waited until this month to confirm if my speculations were correct; I had not set up a payment and the monies are pending in my account for a payment. I made a call to the company because I did not set up those payments. I received an email on 7/15 (5/15 also) that instructed me to call the company before noon central time to have the payment changed or cancel the authorization.  I spoke to Biance on 7/16 who told me the payment is pending but she could not do anything and had to escalate my call. She escalated my call to her supervisor ****** who then informs me it will take 14 days for the escalation team to review. I had two questions for the supervisor; please point me in the right direction on the website where I set up the payment and why does it not show any scheduled payments nor recurring payments?  I will allow the state to investigate, and I would like to open a case for the SEC to look at this company because I know I am not the only customer this is happening to. Biance attempted to tell me to have my bank reverse the charges - that should not have been her response when I am following the instructions on the email. I did take care of disputing the charge with my bank and I also had them close my account. Also, the website does not allow you to remove your card as a payment and it does not allow you to make any changes on payments pending.  Biance did remove my card from the account.  This is very illegal and bad practice for this business. "
"This credit card company is the worst credit card I have ever had. I lost my job and tried numerous times to resolve my account and I have made payments 2 in one month to bring my balance down but was told by a representative if I make 2 payments in the same month it does not account for the next months payment, every month I was assessed a ***************************************************************** with mommy balance and waiving late fees. I closed the account and they are still going to assess 40 dollar late fees every month if I dont pay the past due amount. This card I regretfully ever applied for. I hope this information gets out to people like myself so that they do not apply for this credit card. "
Someone stole my identity and got a loan through Avant. I contacted Avant and let them know that my identity was stolen. They sent me an identity theft affidavit and I filled it out. I sent in all the proper paperwork and filed a police report to ensure that they move that negative account off of my credit report. Now the negative report went to collections and Avant still have not contacted me. What do I have to do for them to remove this loan from my report. I did everything they needed me too on my end. I have placed fraud alerts and security freezes on all three credit bureaus. I need this off of my report. This is not right! I did everything I was suppose to do in order for this situation to be disputed. PLEASE HELP ME!!!!
"I paid my credit card balance down to $0.00 recently.  A month later, I got billed under two names out of nowhere; the total came up to $190.00 plus.  I then tried to call them to question these charges and no one answered.  I attempted several times and waited even for 30 mins and I was unable to reach a ""real person"".  I have never experienced this before with a credit card company. I am canceling this card IMMEDIATELY!! "
Unprofessional staff & unsuccessful outcome with this company.  I do not recommend.
"I have fraudulent charges on my account and I have spent countless hours on hold to speak to an actual person. Got a person one time then was transferred to the fraud **** was on hold an hour and had to hang up. I got an email saying the blocked my card and they are investigating the charges. Lo and behold, I just got another fraudulent charge while my card was supposedly blocked by Avant. This is absolutely the worst credit card company I have EVER dealt with!!!! Not to mention the customer service, if youre lucky enough to speak to anyone, SUCKS!!!"
"Avant did this to me twice. I was set up for auto pay. For some reason, one month my auto pay was shut I off and they took my entire balance $781.96. I live on a fixed income and this wiped me out. This company is a scam and everyone should be informed. I called to get my money back and was refused. Something needs to be done. "
"Avant- is definitely a Scam. They are not a legitimate company, they may give you a card but after one or two purchases ***** the card and then charge you an annual fee or charge something to card and then want you to pay but if want to purchase a coffee it will decline. ***************** Beware "
"2nd month using Avant credit card.  I use ""using"" lightly!  Friday I was buy some stuff and tried to use Avant card, ""Denied""!  Called Avant, 45 minutes waiting for customer service.  They had an computer error and looking into it and will send email when I can use the card.  This was Friday, checked Saturday; nothing in email.  Called Avant again, waited another 40 minutes; again girl could not tell me anything expect you payment is due on August 13.  I already paid for July 13th **** and its only July 9th.  Rude as girl, didn't know anything!  Checked my email, nothing; checked my avant account online.  It still says ""active"", what a joke!  Tried using it again, ""DENIED"".  Now its Monday after noon, ""DENIED"" again!  Called Avant , girl answered; told me the engineering is looking into the problem.  I told her its been 4 days, how long does it take to fix this problem?  Can you explain what is the problem?  The only answer, ""engineering "" is looking into it.  Can I speak to a manger?  She is speaking with another person, will call back.I regret getting this card!!!  What is the use having the card, when you can't use it!  "
"If I could give less than one star I would honestly do so. This is the worst credit card company that I've ever experienced in my life. The issue started on July 7, 2022, when I logged in to check my account. I noticed a red flag across my account stating that my account was blocked. I called to see what was going on after waiting on hold for 40 minutes. I was told that there was a fraud charge on my account. I confirm that it wasn't fraud and that I had made the purchase. If I never checked my account I would've never known this even existed because they didn't reach out. After being on the phone for almost 1.5 hours it was finally escalated to a supervisor and she contacted the fraud department. Usually, with a suspected fraud charge they reach out and ask if it was you. I told her I did not need a new card because it was a purchase I made and do NOT send me another card. The supervisor escalated this situation to her supervisor. She told me instead of waiting 2 business days to have this resolved it would be resolved by COB which would be no later than 11 pm EST. The next day on 7-8 I noticed I had the blocked red banner off of m account I attempted to make an amazon purchase and it was declined. I called and was told my card was active but the purchase was declined because all cardholders are unable to make online transactions. I was able to use my card 7-9,7-10, and 11 with no issues. On ****, I made an online Jersey **** transaction and it was approved. I went to the grocery store that was declined and attempted to make an ezpass purchase which was declined. The code I received was suspected fraud. I called the company again and they said oh your card doesn't work because we sent a new one. This is all after the supervisor removed the hold and me being able to use my card every day since.If I could erase this whole account I would. Now I owe them money of course but I wish I NEVER OPENED THIS ACCOUNT.I DO NOT RECOMMEND AT ALL!!! PLEASE AVOID!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Worst credit card ever. Card got marked fro fraud after 1 DoorDash use. Called to say yes it was me and was told their system is down and its a global issue. Its been over a week and I still cant use my card. Told I have to wait till they send me an email. 
I have received a approval and a card in the main. I activated the card but when I went to use it the transaction was declined. I was on hold for over 30 min just to be told that I would receive a email. The customer service representative was trash and not h a helpful one bit. I seriously regret using Avant. RUN! Don't walk away. RUN!
My Avant card was declined at a business using SquareAvant says it was attempted 4 times I dont know if Im the fine print it says the card is not compatible with Square but buyer beware.  Also the card was declined again at a **** and when I called I was on hold for a ridiculously long timeaccording to Avant there is a glitch in their system. They have no idea how long its been an issue nor how long it will take to resolve.  I did not receive notification that there was a glitch and my card is associated with several utility and other bills that I pay with it to say Im furious and highly frustrated is an understatement.  They received my payments in full and now I dont have access to that credit .  This is wrong and should have more consequences than we apologize for the inconvenience. If not resolved VERY soon I plan to file a formal complaint need to find a different card!  
This credit card company issued me a card that I can't use. I tried for 2 days after the card was received.  I had to call the fraud department 4 times because the card got locked. I attempted an online purchase they locked my card again. I tried to pay a ****. My card was locked and customer service was terrible.
"Avant is a Scam!They are no help at all. I am a victim of fraud with 10 fraudulent charges on my credit card. I called the fraud department, and I was told I will get a call back. Im still waiting. I also tried again, but i get put on hold for hours. It's pretty obvious theres been a data breach, multiple similar complaints on Avants ******** about fraudulent charges. Fix this problem now! "
I've been paying 100$ FAITHFULLY my checks are posted on 1st every month I've been sending 100$ Money Orders they've received payments on next day THEY'RE LOGGING MY MONEY ORDERS IN AS CHECKS CHARGING ME 30$ LATE FEES HOLDING MY PAYMENTS 14 DAYS
"At best, AVANT credit card company is a fourth rate operation!On Sunday July 3rd I received an email from AVANT which I believed to be fraudulent. Below see the two charges that I did not make.DateTimeAmount*Merchant NameLocation 07/0314:33:0087.17PF CHILDROMEO480CO 07/0314:33:0087.17PF-CHILDROMEO480CO I called the AVANT and spoke with an overseas young man who stated that besides the first two charges, there were three additional charges pending. I assured him that I did not make any of the charges in question. Here's the reason for the Complaint. In four hours of calling several of their reps., all of whom sent me to their ***** ****** that ***** never answered a single call!!  Here I am once again on Monday July 5th, hanging on the phone for 45 minutes waiting for the ***** department to answer. the phone. This is a garbage company. I asked the last overseas person to close my account and she stated that if she closed it, that I would be responsible for all the fraudulent charges!!!   Incredible!"
This company has no customer service. No compassion . When someone has never been late but once by mistake cant waive fee . I would not recommend this card straight scam  
"Avant, LLC offered me a credit card with no annual fee through Credit Karma. I've never been late paying and have no balance, yet they are charging me $32 and say they began charging 1.5 years ago, meaning they've charged me $64 and will not reverse. They say I've paid this fee before. They also say they ""don't know what I signed up for,"" but my agreement shows a $32 fee. I clearly NEVER apply for a credit card with an annual fee since I have good credit and pay in full monthly. They do not offer anything for this fee, no perks, no reason to agree to it. Please help me get this annual fee refunded, thanks, BBB."
"Applied for a card and made my 1st purchase on this card in May 11 days after I made a payment of $200 which should have taken care of my June payment.  A little over 2 week I made another payment and they tied to take it from a different account for some reason,  it wasn't the account that I have on file. Either way I had already paid my payment for the month either way and as I was setting up a 3rd payment within 38 days of my purchase where I only had to may 1 payment I noticed that there was a $25 late fee. Can so.eone explain how I could get charged a late fee for making 3 payments within 39 days?  And was told it would be resolved but it is still on there! I need help with this issue! "
"Just don't bother. They drag their feet,  ask the same questions everytime you call to check on things. Then after you give them all your stuff they  just let it expire and tell you time ran out and to reapply.. this is now day 13 with 1 hr long  calls to no result and no decision. I have given them everything they ask even changed my bank account back and forth 5 times.. gonna expire again tomorrow and still nothing after another 50 minutes on the phone today. "
They approved me for a credit card ?? in April its June I never received a card but they send me a **** I called and they send out a card twice the first time I received my credit card letter info but no credit card inside so they send another one never received it either then I called them to complain about receiving a credit card **** with out a credit card then they closed my account then I received another letter in the mail with a pre-approved offer with an offer code to then not approve me lol scam 
"I am really sketched out by this company. I submitted an application based on an offer. Was ""approved/offered"" a certain credit line, AF and APR. requested I send in a copy of my license. Did that. Now, they need me to wait to verify information. I was instructed to call. Did that and was told we can't tell you what's going on. Asked to speak to the department that can and was told they can transfer me. All sounds very sketchy. Slightly worried now that I gave my information to a scam company. "
"this credit card is full of ********. i got this card in May 7th 2022, never used it, paid $39 annual fee in May, on the 27th of May account locked for fraud. still lock as of June 13. everybody account seemed to be fraud, that ********. shut them down"
Constantly leaving unwanted and unauthorized recorded messages.  I am on the Federal 'Do Not Call' list so this is literally a FEDERAL OFFENSE.  I have also had my credit rating removed from solicitation lists so they have NO BUSINESS WHATSOEVER contacting me.
Scam credit card!  You people won't even work with someone for a late payment or move a payment date.  I asked to speak with a supervisor and was denied to speak with one.  That's unacceptable.  I'll gladly close my account by paying it off and risk taking the hit on my credit score by doing so because you people are not flexible.
From ******: In writing no annual fee.  Yet $39 added. once I was approved for credit card. 5/31/22 In writing soft credit will not affect credit. My credit score decreased by 7 points for this credit card inquiry. Customers beware!Its not a good report to say one thing and do another. Purchase APR: 25.99%Its bad enough!After speaking with an agent there her attitude was horrible I told her I will be sending the card back! I dont want it!After reading all the reviews I know now more than ever that this card is trouble!
"Ive barely had this card a month and have already had my account locked 3 times for fraud. Everytime I speak to customer service, they can never give me an explanation as to why this keeps happening. I provide them with proof of address and identification and get the account unlocked. Then a couple days later, its locked again. I just spoke with a rep today who had no clue what they were doing and refused to transfer to a manager or supervisor. JR ****** supposedly his name) gave me conflicting information from my account was open to permanently closed to available for use but under review. He also told me it would take 60 days to reach a resolution on my issue. So basically I cant use the card until they figure out what they are doing. I wish I never opened this card, because now this will ruin my credit score if I close this account."
"Avant LLC opened a credit card for someone that obtained my information fraudulently.  I called them as soon as I received the alert from Experian.  They sent me an email with a blank ************************ as to what I was supposed to do to resolve the situation & have the inquiry removed from my credit reports.  I sent them the completed affidavit, signed by the police officer that took my ID theft report, signed by me, witnessed by a third ******************* sent them the official copy of the police report & a copy of the complaint I filed with the ****************** Protection Bureau.I also sent them a copy of my ID & other documents to prove that I am **** faxed this packet of information to them 5/20/22, I received a fax report saying that all pages were sent.  I called Avant on 5/23/2022 & spoke with someone who told me that the documents were received & the issue was being worked on.  Today I received an email that was identical to the first email I got from them telling me to provide the documents I already provided.  I immediately called the customer service number they provided & spent an hour & 12 minutes on the phone with a call center that told me they haven't received the packet of documents.  They were unable to answer any of the questions I asked them.  I posted my experience on social media & was contacted by a customer service ""bot"" asking me to private message them my information.  I did that & I was told to call a different number which sent me to the same call center I already spoke to.  This company makes it easy for people to commit fraud & difficult for the innocent people to dispute the fraud.  This results in ID theft victims being victimized a 2nd time.  This company is trash & should be avoided at all costs!"
"I thought I was the only one seeing that this company did an account review/inquiry pulling my credit report without my knowledge or authorization, recently on 5/13/22. I NEVER EVER DID business with Avant! I come on here to file a complaint and this is happening to other people too! This company need to be shut down ASAP! They pull consumer credit reports without authorization and open up unnecessary credit line. This is FRAUD!!! This is how Identify theft happens!!! Shut this company down now!!! "
"Worst credit card ever.   Three times made to feel humiliated because of card decline for no reason.   They say they are protecting you which is a lie.   Cancellation of card account is in progress.   **************** is not helpful at all, they just make excuses to cover up.   Worse company ever. "
I've been waiting on an answer due to an unauthorized charge for over two months I've recieve no information what so ever employees keep handing up the phone on me and I'm being charged late fees and interest on a charge I never made. This is laterally the worst company I've ever dealt with.
These people are not right all you guys needs to report them to the attorney general for consumer protection  *********** is located at the state captitol  do ask them to send you a form and you send it back to them certified mail.  Do trust this website because they pay these people to keep a A+ rating.  Aint no way in the world they have that with all the complaints they have.  The problem is no one ever reports them  Also call the local new media and complain 
"Avant- is the biggest scamming credit card company there is. I was credited $111.87 for a transaction that was credited to me, and I have yet to be given the $111.87 credit from Avant. I called the beginning of April and was told I would see my credit on the account/my dashboard by 4/10. I called back on 4/15/22 where I was told the refund should be appearing on my card as an active credit. After fussing with the rep and repeating myself of how the refund hasnt appeared on my account yet, I was told by the rep that an inquiry would be submitted on my behalf. I received a response from the inquiry that stated the credited amount would show on my dashboard as of May 1st. Today is 5/16/22 and STILL no credit. I called back and the rep began to spew out her scripted response. I finally told the rep that they were the worst credit card company on the planet earth and that I would be closing my account. Its unfortunate that we the consumers have to suffer when dealing with companies like this. BBB should really update Avants score to an F, they are NOT an A grade company. "
"After i applied for credit with this company for a  credit card after going through some hardships i felt i could rebuild my credit profile with this company. One year later with no late payments they have not lived up to the lie they have told, wouldn't recommend this company to anyone one."
"This would be ZERO stars for Avant, LLC if this site would allow it. I have been the victim of identity theft since last year. I locked all my credit reports and am using an expensive identity theft protection software. I also had fraud alerts on all three bureaus. Even so, a thief was able to get a credit card through Avant and abuse it. Although I did not lose any money, this thief going over the credit limit, lowered my FICO score by 52 points. I called Avant and they referred my complaint to their fraud division -- I have not heard from them yet. The number for Avant listed on the credit report was a dead number -- I had to find their number on their website. They said they would get back to me but as I see in other reviews here -- I might be waiting a long time. I filed a report with the *** and with my local police department. I don't think anything will keep Avant from pursuing their shady business, however.Be very wary of dealing with this company!!"
Wish I could do -0-I  needed paid in full Ltr for Mortgage Loan closing! After calling for a week ! They refused - because I over paid them $7.00! Awful- ****************** which is useless ! Cant talk to Mgr!! Unprofessional!! Dont get anything from this crazy company *one step up from being a FRAUD !! 
"My experience is similar to many I am discovering and I will emphatically state that the fact that this company has a BBB rating of 'A' is an absolute joke! I received an alert from my credit monitoring service (CMS) stating that I had attempted to open a line of credit (fraud). I contacted Avant with my CMS and was told (after some effort) that they would send me an affidavit of fraud within a couple days. It has been weeks and nothing.  I have called and emailed repeatedly since but to no avail. Last week I called, was transferred twice, then given yet a different number which I had to hang up and call (couldn't be transferred), and after all that I was not even provided so much as a reference number! All they could do was give me an email where I can send my questions. Completely dismissive and to say they are incompetent would be a gross understatement.This company needs to be thoroughly investigated."
Someone needs to investigate this company. They sent a letter to my 91 y/o father stating he'd been denied a loan he had applied for. He didn't apply for any loan. When I called Avant they hung up on me. They even spelled his name incorrectly. This has to be a scam. BBB needs to re-evaluate this so called business.
"I called on a Friday at 11:58 am EST to request a cancelation of payment since the **** was not actually due for 3 weeks and I could have used that money. The payment had been made very early that same morning and was still processing. The representative I spoke with at around 12:04 pm EST informed me that the policy was that same-day payments could not be canceled if the request is made after 12 pm CST. I responded that it was only 11 am CST so they should still be able to cancel it. She continued to argue with me and at one point tried to hang up before I requested to speak to someone else.She stated she would put in a request for a supervisor to call me. It is now the following Monday and I have yet to receive a call nor do I expect to. Immediately after my conversation on Friday I called my bank and requested they put a stop payment. I called Avant today to close the account, which I have only had for about two weeks. The statement already has the $59 annual fee which the representative said any unused portion would be returned. I hope that is the case, however if their business practices are not fraudulent they are at the very least unethical. I could not in good conscience recommend this company."
"The fact that this company has a BBB rating of 'A' is an absolute joke. They recently showed up on my credit report stating that I had attempted to open a line of credit, a hard inquiry was placed on my account, and my credit score dropped by 40 points. I worked with their fraud team for over a month to resolve this issue; after I completed all of the tasks to dispute the fraudulent inquiry, I received an email that they sent a notice to all of the credit bureaus. After contacting the credit bureaus separately, each stated that there was no communication from Avant disputing the hard inquiry. I reached back out to the Avant fraud department several times to get an official letter stating this was a fraud and they have been silent. This will likely be on my credit report for years now because of their lack of cooperation. This company needs to be thoroughly investigated because I am now finding this is not the first time this has happened."
I applied for an Avant credit card a month ago.  I was charged 59$ and it immediately showed on my credit report.  So I paid the 59$ and still haven't received a card after sending numerous emails stating I paid and haven't received a card. I was supposedly approved for a 300$ limit but I still have nothing. ********************
"Received my first monthly statement, min payment was $25 the entire **** was $271.42, I paid the entire balance.  I checked my statement days later and my payment was posted, however, it was not reflecting in my available credit.  I called to inquire and was told that although my payment was posted and my balance owed is zero - my available credit will not update to my credit limit for 10 days.  I asked why it took 10 days when the money was taken from my account immediately and was told that was their policy.  I told them I wanted to closed my account and was told that I may have to pay a penalty if I closed my account.  I'm not understanding how a company can receive payment, acknowledge the payment but not credit your account for 10 Days???  The representative kept talking over me and script reading, she wasn't hearing my concerns.  Needless to say I closed the account and strongly advise anyone to NOT go through this company.....shady business!  I only marked one star because negative 20 wasnt available"
"I have only had the Avant Credit Card for a few months. I set the account for Autopay. As a courtesy to WebBank, I made charges using the credit card, but when I try to pay extra above the minimum, which is the autopay, too frequently I cant get to my account on the Avant Mobile App. This morning, 3/25/2022, I tried to open the app using Face Recognition plus the password, and the screen says my account has been locked due to suspicious activity, and directs me to call the number listed, which is an automated attendant. I was asked to enter my DOB plus the last 4 digits of SS, which I did. I tried to check the balance, the music came on, and I never got a response in 5 minutes, checked using the time on my iPhone. This is not the first time this has happened "
"I received an alert that someone had placed a credit inquiry on my account--the name was Webbank/Avant LLC. I hadn't applied for a loan or tried to open an account. I called Avant LLC immediately, and they said their fraud department would get back to me in 5-7 business days. In the meantime I put a freeze on all of my accounts, filed a police report, and watched my accounts like a hawk. Of course my credit score had decreased. Over a week later I received a request that I submit a bunch of paperwork to them, file a report with the **** get a document notarized, etc. I did all of that, sent it off a few weeks ago, and haven't heard a peep from their fraud department. Yesterday I received an alert that the credit card account with Avant is open, and there is a $39.00 charge, (from everything I'm reading from similar situations it's a fee.) At this conjuncture, it is clear they haven't done anything to stop this person from opening the account. Weirdly, this person took out the account with an old address and my maiden name--it's pretty clear Avant doesn't actually do a proper credit/background check. Now I have account disputes going with Transunion, Equifax, and Experian to get this matter resolved. I am incredibly freaked out, frustrated, and disturbed by this company's practices, and I hope they will be shut down soon, because everyone seems to be encountering fraudulent accounts with them. "
"I was a loyal card holder looking for help. I was paying my **** online as I normally do and noticed charges  totaling more than $1700 from several merchants on JANUARY 18 2022 in hopes of helping me ( a loyal customer who has ALWAYS paid my **** on time for years APRIL 2019 and never had a problem, not even a late payment). I immediately called in and reported  my lost card and the charges that were not from me. I was transferred to the fraud department where I explained and pointed out all those charges that were not from me. I was told someone might contact me for more information and a full investigation would be conducted. On february 8th I receive a letter stating that the investigation was complete in less than 2 weeks and a decision was made making me responsible for all charges.I have been trying to contact someone (S..... from the ***** MANAGEMENT TEAM but oddly her phone goes directly to voicemail and she NEVER CALL BACK.even as I have left multiple voice messages stating this is a urgent matter . I am completely devastated and disappointed in your company which also seems a bit sketchy being that there are over 300 complaints similar to my situation on the BBB website. I've never heard of a company that have a DEPARTMENT MANAGER  that #1 has no last name on the letter at all & #2 phones go straight to voicemail and never return calls. I would hope to have this matter resolved as soon as possible and speak to someone who can really conduct an investigation and replace my money back on my card because I am a VICTIM. As I read all these other customer complaints so similar to mines I Hope that this company finally get shut down and we all get justice in these matters. This is so unfair and flat out robbery! "
"I was notified today through my credit monitoring agency that my credit score had changed.  When I checked, it had changed by 49 points.  Someone had opened an account with Avant without knowing, as the status stated, ""WEBBANKAVANT"".  I called WebBank through the number on their website.  The person help me close the account, however every time I asked for information about the account, like the type of account it was, what was the balance, where was the transaction made; I was put on hold for 2-3 minutes.  After the account was ""closed"" (which I have no verification is was closed), they ""transferred"" me to credit services, which I was on hold for about 5 minutes an then the call was dropped.  When calling back, I chose the option that sounded like credit services.  That person notified me that it needed to be dealt by Avant, which it seemed she was not.  She transferred me to ""credit services"".  The next person told me that I needed to speak with ID Fraud and gave me another phone number to call, which resolved to Metro Credit Union in ******, which seemed odd that I was speaking to a place near where the transaction took place.  A person answered the phone, asked my name, and then put me on a long hold.  Someone different eventually picked up, they ""registered"" my fraud claim and stated that the fraud department would contact me ""via email"" in 5 days.  When asking for a phone number for the fraud department to be able to call if I did not receive correspondence in 5 days, they told me I could only email them.After speaking with 5 different people, I am still unsure if my account was closed nor if my ID theft / fraud was registered.For a company that specifically states that they take security seriously, the maze of calls did not give the impression.  The people themselves sounded sympathetic, however without confirmation that my time was valued by the company, it all seems useless.  I have little faith that I will receive an email in 5 days"
"I was late on my payment by 3 days, it was an oversight, had never been late before. I called to have a one time late fee removed and was informed I would get a decision on it.

They claim they dont show a payment at all, meanwhile theyve taken more than I agreed to. Im more than upset that their system is so antiquated that they cant even see these charges! Ive asked for my call to be escalated, and no one will answer. It sounds like the customer service people work together in their living room while playing a card game. The most unprofessional experience Ive ever had with a credit card company. At this point I dont care what they do, Ill not use them again. Oh by the way, they denied my late fee removal request also lol "
"I have a credit card  with Avant. After talking to a customer because of a late payment charge  on my account  and paying the necessary amount that he told me to get updated with my payment, I found out I was charged another late fee for not having have much needed payment to bring my account to current.  I have requested for a waiver but got hang up on the phone TWICE!!! Their customer service is very inept!! I think this credit card company is just out to make monies by charging unreasonable fees1 "
"Very first payment was late but they said I could make a payment from my bank on the 26 of January.  I'm  sending it Jan 26th 2022 24 hour post office.  If they s**** me I'll give them to my Helps lawyer. I don't have to pay them anything by law as Social Security is protected by federal law also V.A. and Federal pensions. If they are going to lower my credit score I might as well not pay them at all  If they s**** me over on this payment including the 25 dollar late fee I'm  turning them over to Helps a non profit law firm I pay for every month. NOTE: If you have Soical Security, Railroad pension, civil service or V.A. you are protected by Federal law. I'm  giving them one more chance and they'll never get my acct. Numbers.  Completely evil, extremely evil deceitful company. "
"**** BUSINESS days to process payoff, spoke with representative and they could not provide me with a copy of that policy. Paid off balance, but they want to charge me interest a cured the month before!!! Asked to cancel card and they stated I could do that today but they would have to wait till my payment cleared their system on the 15th. Payment was deducted from my account on the 7th!!!. I asked for manager to speak about policy and them maybe waiving the annual fee instead I was hung up on!!! DO NOT EVER GET THIS CARD!!!!!"
Avant customer service is backwoods and completely useless. Unless you would like to provide your social security number and each person is more rude than the next not using very good manners or completely incompetent. There's no other way to speak to someone unless you give the last four digits of your social security number. 
"I have had an account with Avant since June of 2021. I have tried multiple times to activate my card and with the first card I was told I had reached the activation limit. From that point I have been sent 4 more additional cards which I did not activate but had the rep try to activate. They all received the same error of too many attempts even though it was the first time trying to activate it. The account number has been changed (by my suggestion) and still it did not rectify the issue. None of the reps have any clue what they are doing it seems and have no senior leadership there to instruct them on how to fix the issue. I have been told multiple times that my issuer would be escalated and the time frame keeps changing from 7 days to 7-10 business days, to 15 business days. This seems to be done just to get me off the phone but no one clearly has a way to fix this. It seems to be and with my name i assume cause &nbsp;nothing is fixing the issue. I paid the annual fee the second I got the card and have never been able to use this account. I asked for a refund for that and for some reason my payment which they received in 2 days. Will take 3weeks to refund? This has been the worst customer service experience I've ever had at a credit card company."
"Avant *****. I should be paid up by now. It seems like there is always an issue moving my payment dates to happen  on the pay days but they take it out, leaving me in the hole before payday."
I applied for a credit card through Avant on ***** I received my card agreement info on **** in that packet there wasnt my credit card so I called Avant customer service for the rep to confirm if the card was suppose to be with that agreement or come in a separate piece of mail. As per the rep she advised it was suppose to come with the agreement canceled the card and issued me a new one. I called back the next day **** as my email on file was incorrect . As I called I advised them of the card situation to confirm a new one has been sent and the customer service rep this time advised she first rep was wrong and shouldnt of canceled the original card as the card comes in a separate piece of mail. Move forward to **** my original Card comes in the mail. Unfortunately at this time I cant use the card and waited for the new card to arrive in mail which came in mail ***** I went to use the card to now find out my card is locked due to fraud from the first rep reporting my card lost I called customer service numerous times asking for a supervisor put in 3 requests for a call back still have not gotten 1 call back cant speak to anyone in the fraud department directly I emailed twice and still no reply. I am trying to get the card unlocked as now I have both cards in my possession and this company on my credit report for a credit I cant even use. This company is a scam and can not speak to anyone higher up then a customer service rep also I changed my email multiple times and its still incorrect so my information is all going via email to a stranger besides. 
"This credit card company treated my like p***  I had a seizure and some jerk robbed me during it and stole *********************** and all my money. 16 of my creditors honored zero fraud liability, the thief made $529 worth of purchases on my avant- card and they are forcing me to be liable without even contacting the merchant or police or honoring their Mastercard logo duty to investigate the crime and not me liable. The customer service team ***** horribly and have no authority to correct anything .  I am filing a complaint with the fec and the BBB. Go with a reputable bank, both one owned by the predatory finger hut magazine scam bank web bank. Everything they offer takes advantage of those less fortunate and makes us poorer. Stay away!! "
So I was approved in November for $2500. You checked my credit. I waited for funding since November and still nothing. After several issues with customer service I finally go to the site again who said I needed to verify my email address. Once that happened it ran my credit again and came back as denied. This is the worst loan company I have ever dealt with. I could have had a loan with another company but since my credit was run twice I can not even go with another company. I am beyond upset and disappointed with your company and its services and I will let everyone know and go on your site and go to the BBB and inform them of this way this loan was handled.  I will also dispute everything on my credit report. This company is the worst and I will never recommend you for nothing. 
"This Company I Advice To Never Ever In Life Get A Card From Them I've Been Dealing With Them For 3mts To Get A Fraudulent Charge Off My Account And Still To No Avail Has Anyone Contacted Me Supervisor ********** I Mean Noone Since October 26,2021 I Advise Ypu To Run And Don't Look Back Never Get A Card From Them ....."
The worst customer service I have ever experienced in my life. Cancelling my card. Id rather swallow a brick through a straw than call Avant customer service with an issue I am having. ******* is not a good employee. I guess good help is VERY hard to find. 
"I accepted an offer after receiving so many. Everything went smoothly no issues. I called to inquire about an email I received about a loan application. The representative stuck to a script and didnt understand anything I was saying. I said I didnt apply for a loan. He saw my credit card application and decided to repot my card as fraudulent. Despite my many attempts to talk he stuck to the script. Ive been calling, emailing, several different numbers multiple emails no help at all. I then get an email telling me to contact them. No I have purchases being denied. This is terrible all because a representative didnt listen or didnt understand me either way I just want the card unlocked.SG"
"If this was available, this company would be rated sub-zero stars. This is a company that targets the ""subprime"" consumers and they have no moral compass to do the right thing as a business. 31 Oct 2021, I, ************************, sent certified mail containing check number ***** to pay for the total balance due with Avant LLC and I had also closed my account due to the business practices of AVANT LLC targeting sub-prime consumers. Avant LLC had signed for the certified mail containing the check on 1 Nov 2021. On 2 Nov 2021 they had cashed the check and did not apply the amount to the balance. On 7 Nov 2021 they applied a late fee of ***** when AVANT had received the total amount of the balance on the account. The previous month I had sent 100 dollar payment and I had never been late. I had closed this account for its deceptive business practices and milking consumers for unjust additional fees. I paid off the account and I would like this company to do the right thing by cancelling the late fee, apply the payment to the total balance. I have filed a complaint with the ***************************************** of Illinois for this unwarranted grab for additional fees.  I will retain attorney if necessary for resolution to this account."
I received a letter from them in email saying I was approved for a loan gave .e the term and payment of loan and what the interest would be everything was set and then they asked for my user name and password for my bank account which they only need to steal money from the account. When I refused they didn't give me the loan 
"Stay away from this company. I got a credit card through them. In July wallet was stolen and charges were made. I filed a police report. They refunded me the charges. Two months later I was charged again for those charges I called. They had stated I was held liable for the charges, even though I didnt make those fraudulent charges. They didnt provide a specific reason, I was told I would get a call from a supervisor, which I never got one. Worst credit card experience ever. Stay away from this company. "
"I recently became aware of a card opened in my name that I didnt do. I called Avant and. They speak to you like your a lier and a thief. I hung up on them and filed a police report and dispute. Today I received to their ID theft affidavit requiring a notory. Few things. First I would never sign any contract including this one with a company I've never done business with. 2The nearest notary to home is 45 miles and charges and charges $59 minimum for this service. So not only am I an id theft victim, I'm now a victim of Avent charging me to do this. I've frozez nexus Lexus and all the rest. Filed my police report and credit dispute. That's sufficient. Oh yeah the lady on the phone caused me of lying because on own the home where it was received. That's true, but I never lived in the home until recently it was a weekly rental to travelers visiting the nearby national park. That doesn't matter either, because I never applied or accepted credit from these clowns. I'll roll the dice before I higher an attorney. Until then they can kiss my.. "
"In October 2020, I paid off my Avant loan early. I received an email stating this was the last payment to be made ""congrats! you paid off your loan!"" I did not receive any correspondence from Avant until September 2021, when Avant sent me an email stating my loan had matured and there was an outstanding payment left.I again made another payment where again, I received an email from Avant stating the loan was paid. Today, on October 22nd, 2021, I received an email from Avant stating ""Congratulations, Avant has forgiven your outstanding balance on your loan."" I see NO documentation on my Avant account that indicates that the loan was unpaid, or that Avant had anything that needed to be ""forgiven"". Absolute fraud. "
"I previously had a loan with Avant a few years back so when they offered me a credit card I accepted. I have not received a single statement. My first payment I had to make by phone because it won't let me access my account online (uh oh, we're experiencing a problem, after letting me login). I have spent at least 2 hours on the phone asking for a statement so I can pay this off and close it. DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THEM. They don't even deserve 1 star."
"As I come here to leave this review, it seems Im the one who didnt do there homework about this company. All I had to do is read the previous reviews and I wouldnt have to be here doing this right now. I called to inquirer about my account balance 10/11/21, after the *** was so rude to me; I found it necessary to speak to a manager. After 5, calls I was asked yet again, to call back for a manager to be available. What financial institution treats you in this manner? None of my questions was answered. No one asked can I take your number and have a member call me back? No one said here is an email address, please send us a message. Alas I was just asked if someone was listening to our call. Extremely unprofessional! I imagine they would be concerned if someone is listening. I read a review about this companies predatory practices and I can definitely concur. Avant contacted me with this pre approved nightmare.   As a customer who is no longer confident in this institutions ability to serve my financial needs. I would worn anyone, especially my ******* brothers and sisters to stay away!!  "
"I'd like to give less then a star, my mother is currently in the hospital and while trying to pay her bills Avant refused to take a payment because I was not her.  I asked would you take it if she was dead and they said no.  It has to be the dumbest thing I have ever heard."
"Fiance Had her id Hacked but caught it early, called Avant to stop the loan that was just issued from processing.  Was told the loan was stopped, but they still funded the loan the next day.  Called them again and they kept giving me the run around, predatory lending at its finest.  They dont care if the loan is real or fake they just want to get the loan issued.  Oh and this was after we had notified all the credit bureau's and put a fraud alert on her id.  They should be shut down as they are going to cost the tax payers money when they default on their own loans."
This company told me i was qualified for a loan and a credit card and after i did a few things they denied me and dropped my credit score down by over 43 points after telling me there would be no credit pull or damage to my credit they need to be put out of business
"I've been an AVANT customer for years. Have taken out 3 loans without any problems. ALL payments have been made on time. Never a late payment. Never a returned payment. Never an nsf payment. For years....no problems. Yet this past week, I submitted an application for another loan. Years back with my first loan, I worked for the company that I now OWN! Years back the money in the bank was no where near what I have now! Years back, my applications were accepted. Yet with this application... I was denied! More money and in a better position.. yet denied?? No explanation! And that if I wanted an explanation... I would have to wait 30 days after I request it. What happened to AVANT? I know that they have a new CEO, and that the last one was only in that position for a year. Are things going bad with AVANT? I just want to know why I was not approved?? I just want to know... where is the AVANT I'm used to working with? Where is the AVANT that was always fast and friendly? Where is the AVANT that I always gave great reviews to? Where is the AVANT I've always told people about? smh"
"When I first started using Avant, they seemed like a great company to help you establish credit. I started with a 4K loan and halfway through payment, they reached out and asked it I would like more funds. I accepted and was given a **** loan. Payment plan of 339 dollars for three years. I paid every single payment on time for three years, paying and making the last payment on July 19, 2021. All payments were auto enrolled, which made it convenient.On September 9, 2021, I received an email from Avant, that I had an outstanding balance with interest. I was confused as I paid off the loan in July. In looking at my account, it stated that I had only paid 94% of the principal loan and still owed  $402 dollars and no payment was scheduled as July was my last one. After contacting customer support, they come up with a story that I changed a date in 2018 and the 400 dollars accumulated over the three years. However, in looking at all my payments over the three years, not one of them are missing or changed. I also asked for it in writing  where I supposedly changed this date. The agent said that was impossible since it was a verbal agreement. What a load of c*** How can I not be notified two months after payoff that I still owe and drawing interest? I no longer trust this company and I would not do business as well. Buyer Beware!"
"No resolution offered by the Avant Representative and Supervisor. The total amount of my balance, close to $870.00 was withdrawn from my checking account without my approval.  I would not have authorized that amount as I am living paycheck to paycheck.I can't pay my mortgage. Other bills have bounced leaving me with a negative balance.I'm disgusted."
"First of all trying to even see your **** is a joke because if you try to just type in avant.com on ****** and hit their site it shows an error. The only way you can get into their site is to hit apply for a credit card and then log in. I wanted to dispute a charge on my account so I called customer service 7 times until it was finally resolved. I had been disconnected 4 times and just on one phone call was transferred to the wrong department 6 times and had to verify my date of birth, social security number and name and card number on every department they had sent me to. Finally after an hour on the phone was able to resolve my issue but my blood pressure must have almost exploded. They have the worst customer service reps I have ever experienced  "
I recently opened an account and closed it after 1 payment. This company floats your money. Once payment is sent it takes up to 2 weeks before credit is available. I have never heard of such a practice!!
"This company does not deserve a star they are thieves, I tried paying  my monthly payment around 9pm the site would not let me so I called them the rep is letting me know I cannot pay my monthly payment after 5pm on due date..does that makes sense after going back and forth with her I asked to speak to the manager and after putting me on a fake hold she is going let me know her manager is not available but will give me a call...really...this company is a scam please do not fall their lies do not get a credit card from them and just to think they have my personal info."
"Run far away from this loan shark.  This company preys on people looking to fix their credit and take advantage of people with bad credit.  The interest is extremely high, extra payments do not go towards the principle balance, they are not customer friendly, nor are they sensitive to those customer's needs and financial situation.  You will end up paying back twice of the loan you received if you take out a loan with them. If you decide to take out a loan with them make sure you are fully aware of the fine print and the invisible ink!! You've been warned!! Don't borrow money from Avant.  """
"illegal practices. took 3 months to make sure account was *** accepted, used or activated. it took numerous calls and emails from march 2021.  all of a sudden it showed up on my credit reports as 4 DELINQUINCYS!!!!! ***** HEARD **** THEM, ***** RECEIVED A **** UNTIL JUNE 24 2021. ****** ** THEM AGAIN **DAY AND **** AGREED ** CANX THIS AND GET IT OFF OF MY CREDIT REPORTS.

They send my credit card to the wrong address. And now they have refused to update my address and send the card to the correct address. I asked for a letterhead letter stating when I pay the card off it will be closed and I was hung up on
"I was approved for a 2,000 dollar loan. I was supposed to get the funds within 24 hours, as seen on the advertisement. I have been wanting 2 weeks so far. I have called numerous times as to why the funds have never been received. The company has told me my bank is rejecting the deposit. I called my ***************, they told me no deposit has even came in, that every deposit would have a code. I have called the company many times and keep getting the runaround about why the funds havent been received and verified my account information many times as well. They have even set up my first payment without my getting the loan funds. That has happened twice now. This is a horrible company. I waited for a supervisor for 45 minutes to be told he would call me back. When he was supposed to have called me back at 9:30 this morning and never did. DO NIT USE **** COMPANY! "
"This company has been absolutely wonderful! As a recommendation to rebuild my credit starting in 2014, I took out a loan with Avant. They got me the money in a very timely manner and the customer service was great. After a while, I was placed in a bad position when purchasing a house. I fell into collections with Avant. They were still courteous and helped all they could to help get and keep me on track. Another while later, I lost my job and my house. I had lost the ability to pay anyone during this time. I never heard from Avant. But they continued to report me good on my credit report. I vowed to repay that last little bit that I owed them when I found another job but I was never able to keep the job long enough to get to a point to repay that final amount. Yet, they continued to report good on my credit report and never tried to collect it. Fast forward to today, I have been on my current job for the past six months and I was putting Avant in my plans to pay the last payment on this loan. I get an email saying that the final amount has been forgiven! I was floored. I am almost in tears writing this because I really wanted to do right by this company to settle the debt as gratitude for the way they have treated me. I am not saying that they will do this for everyone, but as for me, I cannot thank Avant enough for this and your service and patience with me over the past few years. I am very sorry that I fell just short of completing this loan. I still intend to write a direct letter to the customer service department giving my sincerest gratitude for this. After this, I would recommend Avant, LLC to anyone who needs a loan. No company is perfect, but with effort, kindness, and willingness to resolve your issues, there are businesses that will work with their customers for the benefit of both parties. Thank you again Avant for everything!!"
I made a payment on my card on my mobile app it states $0 due I made a $25 payment. Now with this company there is also a 10 day grace period If I was late which I wasnt as my mobile app said no pmnt due at this time it was day 4 so not only was I not late they charged me a $25 late fee what would have been 4 days in on a 10 day grace period. Stay clear of these people! They just want extra money!!! 
"Avant is absolutely the ***** COMPANY I have ever dealt with.  I paid my account in full and at the end of the loan they wanted another $1,192.  I called over 10 times and sent 4 emails asking why I was being charged the additional amount and asking for a simple breakdown.  All they did was sent me a copy of my contract.  Stay as far away from this company as you can.  It charges an enormous amount of interest and gives you absolutely no answers to simple questions.  ********, ******** COMPANY.  I would not have even given it one star except I had to in order to proceed.  "
"The ******* is one of the worse I've dealt with. I received an email stating someone activated a card under my name. I contacted them immediately. They claimed to have put a lock on this card. The immediately i get another email stating same person was trying to use it at a ********. Once again i contacted them based on their email recommendation. Now, its been this back and forth questioning whether I had applied for the card, dismissing the fraud activity. I've gone back and forth providing their own documentation along with the affidavit and still no movement. Last resort will be legal action. This company does not know how to handle this situations and customer service is something to be desired. Unreal..."""
"I have a loan with Avant. I recently tried to pay  more than my normal payment with a credit card, ****** and a cash app card but Avant would not except the payment because its not a checking account. I dont understand if I want to make a bigger payment I should not be rejected. I called the business and talked to a supervisor and I was denied to talk with corporate office. If I want to make a payment with a cash app card or ****** I should not be rejected."
"Avant ***. Is a bunch of snakes! Beware, they are racists, bigots, and a lot worse. They hire people of color because it is cheap, not because it hires American workers. They claim to refinance your loan but *** made every payment on time, and met ******** of their qualifications but have been denied! They are liars and cheats! DO NOT TRUST THEM WITH THE ***** OFF YOUR ****!"
"***Y *** LIERS , ************** GIVE FALSE INFO. CREDIT **** DOWN 120 ***** FOR SO CALLED **** PAYMENT WHEN IT WASNT **** WAS SO CALLED TOLD A ***** EXTRA WOULD BE ADDED AT *** ****** MY LOAN , ***Y REPORTED ME **** WHEN I WAS ***. "
"I got a loan in 2017 with this company. I ran into a few problems later and deferred a few payments was told that this would not negatively affect my loan. Just this month was suppose to be my last payment (4/11/2021). I get an email that I still have an over due balance. As I see a few people on here had the same problem. Now they want me me to pay an extra 5800 on the loan. But they over charged my interest by this amount and they will not answer any of my questions on the interest. I noticed that this was going to be a problem and I started asking questions month a head of time. The representative just told me that everything was computer generated and then I asked to talk to a supervisor or someone with more knowledge and I never received a call back. Then as I did research I noticed that there was a lawsuit on them and 2019 and that so many people are having problems with this company.  This company doesn't deserve to be in  business anymore and as much as these people who relied on this company for help and they get away from over charging people. They should have been shut down by the ***. I would stay away from this company. I was stuck with a 35% interest  rate and after two years and on time payments they wouldn't even look at lowering the interest rate to help me out. """
Would not provide credit bureaus with proof of payoff timely. 
"Wonderful, except...
The credit card customer service is terrible, there are so many banking standards broken with no experience. The rep basically said I'm only allowed to have 1 card per customer. Even though, I asked her if she could apply for a second one on my behalf and mentioned removing my offers (I like offers)... Not helpful at all. Then I told her I asked because I couldn't get a credit line increase and explained that a second card would be useful. However, to no avant... Sorry, avail* (website doesn't allow you to apply twice even if you have another offer, as soon as it recognized my social it asked if I wanted to not only login but also change my password lol). The rep basically shooed me away with, ""do you have any more questions?"" So I asked, where is Avant's headquarters? And she replied, Chicago, Illinois. Honestly, I love the app, the experience, and everything except not being able to apply twice and the terrible, unregulated credit card customer service that broke so many banking laws in one conversation is not hard to imagine it's happening on every call... You don't tell a client you can only apply once lmaoooooooo. You don't say, without a credit license, apply for a credit line increase after 6 months ****. Anyway, that was my experience with terrible customer service, not being able to apply twice, and just remember, the app is beautiful, excellent job done. Thank you."
At first I didnt have any issues now my account has been locked because I used it to pay for a tow truck and it hasn't been denied alot recently saying its fraud when I am the only one using it but can't 75% of the time. My other issue is it takes a long time for available credit to change after a payment has been made and received.
