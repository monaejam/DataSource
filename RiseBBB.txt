They guarantee approval no matter credit.my credit was fair on this app.they said I was approved then redirect me and say I'm not...they are liats
"I was approved for a loan and it was supposed to be credited to my account on 01/12/2024. I rescinded the loan on 01/11/2024 stating that I no longer needed it. I received a confirmation that it was rescinded. Today, 01/12/2024 they took ***** from my account, but they never deposited the funds so basically they stole the money from me. I called them and they said it had been deposited. We had a 3 way call with my bank and my bank confirmed the money was never deposited so of course my account was negative and I was closing on an apt today in the afternoon. Instead of reversing the withdrawal, they said they would escalate the issue and it would take 3 to 4 business days so I'm negative until next week so no food no nothing. My bank said that it is FRAUD and but since the transaction is still pending we have to wait. Once it is no longer pending, they will file a fraud report. "
"This ""loan"" is still showing open on my credit report. I called today to close it and the customer rep said it will stay open for 7 years.  This account was included in my bankruptcy. I understand it will show as a negative account because it was included however I should be able to close the account. "
"I took a loan out with Rise Credit when I was laid off from my job.   I paid them off off early and over 3 months later, they still have not reported my balance as paid in full to the 3 credit bureaus, which is hurting my credit, showing I owe over $1,700.  I called them and they gave me a dispute resolution email address to write to get it taken care of.  I have written them 3 times in the past 3 weeks and NO RESPONSE.  It is clear they don't care about their customers, ********** because they can't take the time to respond to me, but yet they are sending me solicitations in the mail to try to get me to use them for another loan.   NEVER AGAIN!"
This company was a great starts off good ends bad. When I went to pay my loan off. I was given 3 different amounts. And I over paid and was given less back as a refund. I'm very disappointed in this part of the process.
"Very slow to process pay offs. Cashiers checks are held for 10+ days. They say they are waiting for them to clear.  I sent them one registered next day mail with required signature.  It was delivered and signed for 2 days later.  The check was cleared by my bank, but they would not recognize that, I was told policy was not to post payment ten days later.  I am due a refund for a payment they took from my checking account before the due date.  I now have a credit balance of over $300.  I was informed they hold refunds for 10 days (all there days are working days) before they send a check. They are making money on my money for 20+ dayys on money I sent them!  This company treats their customers new and returning like dirt.Avoid this company  if it is all possible.  I was stupid until I noticed the monthly payment you send them is only interest on the money they loaned you, no money goes to the payoff the money you borrowed!Even if you are having problems paying your bills borrowing from this company only delays bigger problems in the future!  I have learned that if you talk to your creditors they will work with you. A lot of people are having trouble paying their bills courtesy of inflation andour federal government!"
 they gather all info like bank #s and dl#s  and dont approve the loan!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Back in 2020, I lost my job due to the pandemic and hit a dire situation. I was short on rent and car note, and needed the loan to avoid eviction and repossession. I didnt have any other resources to help. So, I resorted to using Rise to get a personal loan. I was desperate and wasnt thinking and just accepted what I could get. I got the loan in about 3 days and was able to keep my car which I was using to pay my bills and keep my family from being evicted, but soon realized I was being put into an even worse situation. After months of paying the monthly payments (not noticing that the principal balance was barely going down), I hit another bad situation. And in June of 2021 I received an email stating that I was eligible to refinance my loan and receive another loan. Stupidly, I accepted, thinking that my monthly payments was paying down the principal. After paying $360 each month for half a year, I decided to re-evaluate my financial responsibilities because things were not getting any better. I checked on the progress of my loan the balance only went down by less than $200! I had paid my bill on time for half a year, but only $156 went towards the balance?! Thats outrageous. I called Rise customer ********************** to inquire about the issue and I was told that nothing could be done because I had agreed to the terms of the contract and accepted the high interest rate. I couldnt afford to keep paying that much per month, and not paying down the balance by a decent amount. Not even my student loans are that bad. Now, I have a looming collection in my credit report. "
This is death zone financial company i don't advise anyone to ever get money from them ??. I borrowed $5000 i have paid $4750 i am still owning over $5000 this a scam they are killing the people 117% interest rate. Without missing a payment since 2022 till now and i had an accident can't  work and they have no solution or any option than to keep paying.  No star for a company like this ?? 
"Mobster, criminal, absolute should be banished, degenerate, shark loaners.This is my fault personally for over looking their garbage details.At the time of borrowing, I needed the money. Long term, it didn't matter, I was going to pay it off quickly.I borrowed $4000 in April 2023. My payment is +/-175$ every 2 weeks.I sometimes paid $200 being the lowest, and $500 at the highest.Today Aug. 11 2023, my previous balance was *****. The debt is barely moving.However, get this! Ready?My new balance is $3,860!!!!That's right. It went UP. I called the criminals.*****, what kind of company makes someones balance go UP, after making payments instead of going down.The sewage replied, well sir, you know you're paying 114% interest. That means your ***** dollar loan means you'll owe us +/-9000$.Yes. My fault in the beginning. Now. Letting the world know that this is criminal. P.O.S. criminal."
"I paid off my loan and still haven't received the refund. They tell you to contact this number, however it doesn't ring, it goes straight to voicemail.They told me via email and over the telephone that my refund was in the mail on two different occasions. When the ""manager"" lady called me she said that, what I was told was miscommunicated to me....so they lied?To date still haven't received funds....I have contacted my attorney."
"They make it seem like they are helping you, in all reality they are hurting you. Their interest rates are between 90 to 100%. Yes they might be able to approve you and put into your account within a few days. However, you end up paying so much in interest rates alone."
I paid off my loan April -15th. They still have not applied the funds. I am continuing to be charged interest. They claim the check has been received. And they are taking payments out of my checking account. 
ONE OF THE WORST COMPANIES TO WORK WITH!! THEY CHARGE YOU MORE THAN WHAT THEY TELL YOU. I HAVE NEVER MISSED A PAYMENT IN 2 YEARS AND NOW THEY TELL ME I'M 3 PAYMENTS PAST DUE... MY RECORDS SHOW I HAVENT MISSED A PAYMENT. ***** AND ******* (MANAGER) DID NOTHING TO HELP ME. THEY BOTH LAUGHED AT THE PROBLEMS I WAS HAVING IN MY PERSONAL LIFE. VERY RUDE AND UNPROFESSIONAL. DO NOT WORK WITH RISE CREDIT. THEY'RE A SCAM.
one star and they made?HORRIBLE ! ! ! 2 minutes?LOL? I'm almost 69 and I need?stealing 30 mins and all of my information and they just dropped me? no explanation? but I can call someone so they can lie to me again? they r all spin and lies? the SAD part is I needed help 
How on earth is rise credit charging ******* seniors 150 per cent interest under the nose of the consumer financial protection bureau at the time that **************** government is not allowing them to charge more than 35 percent interest?      ******* from *******
"I had a loan with rise I got behind on payments not a full 90 days paid it off in January 27. They sent it to collections that same day with zero balance and put a negative **** on my credit report March 4 with zero balance and collections, so what are they going to collect on with zero balance except messing up my credit report "
"I am calling them first thing in the morning. My payments have been on auto draft for a while so I decided to check my payments today. Smh. This is disgusting. After adding up all the payments, I confirmed *** paid this loan off months ago. They still have me with a ***** balance and still auto drafting my account. Just WOW. After reading reviews and people saying they had to get lawyers involved, Im preparing to contact CFTB AS WELL AS FTC. Unlike others, I have a lawyer already and will be prepared"
"I paid off my loan on Nov 12 2022 and it still has not been removed from Experian report. I have called, sent emails with no resolution. This was my 3rd loan with them and after this experience I doubt I will ever use them again! "
I made all payments on time with auto pay. Two months later they show me as still having a balance due. It was paid in full months ago. This caused my credit score to drop by 40 points!!!  Called customer ********************** and was advised that I should send an email to another department.  Why is it my job to fix it?   Shouldnt it be a Rise fix!!!
Wow!! This place is a trip off in got approved for **** but my payment were 221  72 payment = to *****.. At a rate of 149% apr!!! You get to be kidding!! 
I like the company loan approval fast.  Rates are high payoff fast.I paid them off two months ago and they still haven't notified the credit bureau.  I complainted to the credit bureau they finished the report still shows owing
"My soon to be ex husband took out 7 loans under my name without my consent from this company between 2015-2018!!!!!! How did this company allow this with out me even knowing! I have repeatedly asked to have these removed from my credit as I am a victim of fraud and financial abuse, and they continue to deny it. "
The first two times I had a loan from them the payment was the same and it would pay my loan down it didnt rise daily the third time I accepted a loan they did this it rises daily c*** so you end up paying triple the money you borrowed . I feel like Ive been prayed on by my low credit score they took advantage of my situation and now I am stuck paying on this loan til may 2023
I obtained a loan from Rise credit and paid the loan off early. They had automatic payment withdrawal from my checking and took a payment after I paid off the debt in full. I called them the day after and the rep stated she would inform finance. It would take a few business days but they would call or email once they reviewed my account. That was two weeks ago and Ive received no email or call from them. And I have not received my overpayment back yet. This is unacceptable behavior and unfortunately I have to get legal involved to get my money back.
F****** PIMPS!!! Im sure you know their interest rates are high but associates are specially told not mentions the 6% interest added to your balance DAILY if you do not mention it first. I was made 2 huge payments to bring my balance down only to see next month the balance seemed to be increasing. they literally raise the amount you owe them on a DAILY basis. I will forever leave negative reviews for this business and wouldn't  recommend them to my worst enemy
"Do not get a loan from ""RISE"" they make you pay double to triple of your loan. Im almost going on a full year. And not even half way to pay off. So don't make the same mistake u did with this company!!!"
"Loan sharks. Plain and simple. I refinanced another loan to pay this abomination off for good. The financial institution (bank) I used sent them a check via **** for the amount RISE said was a pay-off. This was sent around April 22nd. Three weeks later...nothing. They have NO record of receiving the check for the pay-off amount. Meanwhile, their daily interest amounts were causing the balance to RISE! (I see how they got their name)... They requested tons of info, which I provided to my best abilities and no resolve. So, after calls back-and-forth and some research from the bank I used for my new loan -- they found the check had been returned / denied receipt.  It was the CORRECT address -- a P.O. Box in ******, **. Sent on 4/22 and returned weeks later. So, after some back-and-forth again, I was told an overnight check would be credited to my account same day as received and my bank sent them a check OVERNIGHT via ***** on 5/17...with tracking...to their ""Overnight Payment"" lock box/physical address in **********, **..it was received and signed-for on 5/18 at 9:38am. 5pm rolls around and no credit to my account. Same on 5/19. On 5/20 I contacted RISE and was told a note on my account said the check was received and should post on that day by 5pm. As of 7pm, I now have a balance $433 higher than pay-off and no credit to account. A call to them again -- no record of receiving any checks, just notes on my account about my calling them previously and ""why can't you just pay it off and let the bank reimburse you?"" comments made (because banks don't work that way when THEY want to pay-off a loan). They've escalated my ""ticket"" and allegedly will call me within 24 hours. Meanwhile, I'll have to wait until Monday to contact my bank again to see if the check was cashed, and go through goodness knows what to resolve. I cannot say it enough... I DO NOT RECOMMEND RISE CREDIT FOR ANYTHING! It's predatory lending at best and they're not very professionally operated. "
"I would give them a zero if I could. Someone took a loan out in my name. I contacted them to advise of this fraudulent loan. They couldnt transfer me to speak to someone in the fraud department and I was told they dont  have a phone number for them. She told me the only way to contact them was through email. She told me to include in my loan application and my police report. How am I suppose to send the application when its not my loan? SMH. How does a loan company not have a fraud department without someone to speak too? This company is definitely suspicious, especially after reading all the reviews and my experience. "
they price ***** and charge over 100% interest rate on any loan which i tried to reverse days after obtaining because i had another offer i shouldve read more closely they have made 2290$ off my loan since december. and im just hardly under the amount barrowed ****. and its continuing to increase. NO ONE SHOULD EVER USE THIS COMPANY EVER THIS IS THE WORST MISTAKE
"I would give them a zero if I could. This company isn't about helping people with bad credit, it's about robbing people's pockets that are just trying to get ahead. My credit is in the 600's and I was charged 3 times the amount I borrowed in interest. This company is a scam. Don't let this company rob you of your hard earned money!"
Be careful with time. Borrowed $5000. Paid over $675 in a month a half. Owe more than I did when I took out the loan. Very expensive loan. 
I recently applied for a loan. I was denied due to their system not being able to verify my identity. I was sent an email to call their number to discuss the decision. I asked if there was any form a secondary verification that I can use to confirm my identity. The representative I talked to had a nasty attitude. And I quote The decision is final. No we cannot take any other form of verification. No changes are going to made. I have a real issue with that. If SYSTEM cannot verify my identity but I am able and willing to provide documentation why is secondary documentation not an option. I would like to get this resolved or speak to someone that can help with this issue.
"I have had my first loan with them now for several months and it's already almost paid off. First, not only has my credit score went up drastically. I accidentally missed a payment and a customer ********************** rep called me to help me reschedule and get it paid. That missed payment never effected my loan nor credit. It also is automatically withdrawen from my bank account so I don't have to worry I'll forget. I'm also able to get a higher loan from them as soon as the next day after I pay it off. I'll definitely be using them again. Even have given there name to my friends and family. Like you should try this. "
Signed a contract stating that they will take X amount of my paycheck biweekly and I can make payments towards the principal with no penalties fines these are problems. The first payment was taken out with no problem. The second payment only partial was taken out and they are trying to charge me additional interest. They are also trying to change the terms and conditions of the loan agreement I signed. I had already regretted taking the loan out when I did because the high interest rate but I was put in a position where I had no choice. So I was paying extra to be interest rate. They are not excepting my additional payments and trying to charge me full interest-rate. This is wrong underminded and underhanded. I would not recommend this company to anyone
"Used several times. Each time rate went down. I noticed a few people say they could not make a payment. This has happened to me. I logged on to my account, and payment was skipped, put at rear. Yes interest rates were higher, but very clear on what they were before signing and have the right to cancel loan once I signed. I have never had an issue except once that was my fault. I sent check in the mail to pay off and over paid. They sent me a check in 5 days for the overpayment. My credit was low 500's and with their help to start over, it is now in the low 700's."
"  I decided to get a loan from this company when my hours were cut at my job during the pandemic. Everything went smoothly with Rise Credit until I refinanced my loan after getting it halfway paid off. The pandemic was still going strong and I was settling into a new job. Interest rates are way too high. The balance literally doesnt go down by the time they add 9 dollars a day till your next payment! Highway robbery at its finest, I must say.  A few days ago, I decided to pay the loan off in full. They locked my account from making online payments due to a supposed fraud alert saying the bank declined the payment. After a call with my bank and them checking everything on their end, they said the company didnt even try to process a payment!   The second lie they told me my account would be unlocked after 24 hours so that I could again pay online. My account was never unlocked so that I could pay it, of course. Let me add, Ive never had an issue paying the loan monthly ever. All this chaos didnt begin until I tried to pay the loan off fully on 10/14/21. The third lie I was told on the phone by one of the representatives that I could just overnight a check and that as soon as they got it, they would apply that to the loan the same day and get it taken care of. We put a tracker on the check and also required a signature before release in case anymore lies came up. The check arrived at the front desk in the morning around 11:37 a.m and an employee signed for it. I waited hours before getting in a live chat to get an update. They told me they never received the check. Wow really? I shouldve known. I told them about the **** update and they said their team works on the checks and my check would be posted on 10/16/21. Mind you again; everyday they add 9 or more dollars to your balance.   It is now 10/16/21. It is early in the morning but I decided to just log into my account to see what interest has been added to my balance. Surprise, surprise! I have ZERO account access! I cant even log in and I have no emails of why I cant. Honestly, it feels like I am being held hostage just for trying to pay them nearly 3k to close out the loan and wipe my hands clean of this company! I feel like a football player, the ball is the money, I am trying to get it into the touch down zone and the employees of Rise Credit are acting as the other teams defense keeping it out. This is one football team you dont want to play with. Find another solution! Either they call this game correctly on Monday or my attorney will be the referee. "
I wouldn't give them a 1 star but had to in order to write a review. Don't do it! I paid ****** a month for months. Called the other day to see what my balance is so I could pay it off...its higher than what I borrowed! How in the heck can that be possible?? They will steal you blind! 
Everytime I pay towards the loan they take all of it for interest I borrowed $4000 and buy the time I pay it off I would have payed them $7000 in interest.They adding interest d as daily 148 percent interest. Don't borrow from them because they make it seem easy.Rip off loans.
"WORST PROCESS AND CUSTOMER ********************** EVER!!! DO NOT ENGAGE.. 1 star is too generous!To begin, I was sent a PRE-APPROVED LETTER for a loan amount. I thought this would be good for a small business start up revenue. The service and level of repeated requests for the same document is ridiculous. I was asked to send these documents over and over again in various forms and when I obliged, it was always something wrong. I sent these forms in pdf, after being told the 7th time, and then they were still unable to be opened. I spent more than 24 hours back and forth with this company about documents received.  I even sent my social security card  and id card sent in 5 images to ensure the edges were showing and that the signature and number was visible. I feel there is some fraudulent activity and makes me feel uncomfortable, especially with agents working from home and their pets and phone issues interrupt the call. Inconsistency:Agents were saying "" this has to go through our verification department"" while other agents ( supervisor and non supervisors) said "" well, I can see right here what is missing and needs to be corrected"". What in the world is going on here?Income verification:This was an atrocious experience. Several of the agents advised me to explain that my second income is 10 months and my primary income is received on the last day of the month. I was repeatedly told that my primary income paystub was outdated I assume because of 6/30/21 being the pay date. Again, being paid on the last day of the month means my next check will not generate until the last day of July. Sadly, I sent a document verifying my next pay, as well and this was still not sufficient. Finally, after about 7-8 representatives, one thoroughly explained that they just needed what the confusion was with the dates and we were able to rectify the issue. All other agents just read the script.FOLLOW UP:After waiting to hear from them a few days, I called and they explained that I have to wait on a phone call to the number thats on my consumer report just to verify I am the real person. The representative, supervisor and On Duty Manager ( *****) all repeated the same information- that this was the LEGAL PROCESS. Each asked me if In wanted a call back..... why would you call me back to tell me ti wait for a callback to verify my number? They were unable to tell me what number , time or date to expect the phone call.  I explained that, just like them I am at work and with all the **** calling my phone may not accept the random or unlisted number. I asked "" what happens if I miss both the phone calls?"" ...... each of them went on to explain that I would need to wait for my application to go inactive and then REAPPLY!!!!Listen, this has been the worst experience of my adult life in terms of borrowing money. I wish I would have read these reviews before provided them with all my information."
"Don't  bother they will not help in anyway. They want all your information then declines  99% of the people."""
"Don't do it!!I was approved for a loan at 118% interest.They don't tell you all this until after you've gone through the entire process.  They cause a hard inquiry on your credit report and after all that I rejected their offer.This should be illegal.  I will make sure everyone knows about their practices.  """
Even with a perfect payment history it's near impossible to get a refi because they don't want to lose the interest they have one locked in at.  Also a human won't talk to you about it saying it's computer generated.
I am so frustrated.  Rise worked with me when I got laid off - I finally was able to pay off my loan but that's when the nightmare started.  They sure put it on your credit quickly but it takes forever to get it off and show PAID.  6 weeks later and I'm still getting excuses.  I've had 6 people now tell me they were going to take care of it and they did not. Over the weekend it was reported that my balance went up by $400 even though I don't HAVE A BALANCE!
I would like to report they are using this company for fraud. An account was opened under my name as Identity Theft and it's now showing on my credit report. Every time I tried to report it they are asking me for so much confidential information even a copy of my driver's license and full social security just to speak to a representative. Crazy! I have already filed a police report and identity theft...This company should be checking more when someone is trying to open a new loan knowing the dangers of identity theft issues occuring lately.
