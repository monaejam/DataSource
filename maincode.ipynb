        "To optimize agent performance, we can provide a custom prompt with domain-specific knowledge. In this case we’ll create a few shot prompt with an example selector, that will dynamically build the few shot prompt based on the user input. This will help the model make better queries by inserting relevant queries in the prompt that the model can use as reference.Now we can create an example selector. This will take the actual user input and select some number of examples to add to our few-shot prompt. We’ll use a SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector, which will perform a semantic search using the embeddings and vector store we configure to find the examples most similar to our input:Now we can create our FewShotPromptTemplate, which takes our example selector, an example prompt for formatting each example, and a string prefix and suffix to put before and after our formatted examples:Since our underlying agent is an OpenAI tools agent, which uses OpenAI function calling, our full prompt should be a chat prompt with a human message template and an agent_scratchpad MessagesPlaceholder.

They refuse to help and communicate with him even though I have had surgery done on my vocal chords. Their solution was for me to hire someone to go into more debt in order to pay off their debt. By far the worst experience I’ve had and I do not recommend anyone using this company for a credit card\\n\\nAvant\\nI’m just appreciative of the quick…\\nI’m just appreciative of the quick response the folks gave me when getting the card.

Avant is a solid way to rebuild my credit with a company that is already secure. My experience is been nothing but a five star experience.

I applied through Credit Karma and was told I had an outstanding chance of being approved. I went the through the entire process even getting a hard inquiry on my credit report which I was told would not happen until I accepted the loan. I was even sent a promissory note with all of the loan details. Sent in all the requested documents and speaking with a couple of representatives. Only to be told that my loan was denied. A waste of time if you ask me.\\n\\nAvant\\nLearning the ropes\\nI have used card several times and it was great until I got a decline at grocery. Come to find out because I had used my card a lot in a few days AVANT put a hold on it. I had to call and ask why!

Transparency is the issue.\\n\\n\\nI was offered a 2% rewards card if I applied and opened a new account with Avant through Credit Karma. I did as told. I discovered that two applications were opened when I applied in February 2024.\\n\\nThis concerned me; so,I emailed Avant support asking if the card I was approved for was still a rewards card. (I hadn’t received anything in the mail yet.) I was told to call. I did. I was told that it was in fact the rewards card. I also was told via email that I would receive a separate email verifying the rewards portion. I never did. I tried emailing again and received another ‘call support’ response. So I did. Then the system was down; no help again.\\n\\nI decided to make an approximate $15 purchase to see if any rewards would generate. Nothing. I called again today (05March2024) and was told that it wasn’t a rewards card and that I can’t have two cards. I tried to explain that I only applied for the one. I was given a scripted response. I asked for a supervisor. I was told one wasn’t available and to request a callback when one was. I then closed my account.\\n\\nI will not work with a company that cannot provide a straight answer; especially when it appears that two applications were opened at once without my consent. If you never have to ask for support, this card will be ideal.\\n\\nPlease improve communication.\\n\\nAvant\\nIt is an excellent credit card\\nIt is an excellent credit card.

SO I GET ON THE PHONE AND THIS BEGAN MY HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE WITH THESE PPL THAT COULD BARELY SPEAK ENGLISH .....SO THE CSR LOOKED UP MY INFO AND TELLS ME THAT YES IT IS SHOWING THAT I MADE A PAYMENT ON FEBRUARY 17TH AND THEN IT WAS CANCELED....UUUMMM NO MA\\'AM I DID NOT CANCEL ANYTHING...WHY IN THE HELL WOULD I MAKE A PAYMENT, BY PHONE TO AN AGENT, AND THEN CANCEL IT ...I HAVE OVERDRAFT SO THERE WAS NO CHANCE THE MONEY WASN\\'T THERE....WELL THIS WOMAN ARGUED ME DOWN THAT IT WAS ME OR MY BANK THAT DID THIS NOT THEM ...OK SO I WENT TO THE BANK AND THERE WAS NO SIGN OF ANY TRANSACTION TO THEM ON THAT DATE ,I CALL BACK AND A DIFFERENT RUDE AGENT PROCEEDED TO TELL ME THE SAME THING AS THE FIRST RUDE WOMAN ...NOW MIND YOU THE FIRST THING THEY SAY IS \"YOUR CALL IS BEING RECORDED FOR SECURITY PURPOSES\" SO I TELL THEM OK I SHOULD\\'VE BEEN RECORDED MAKING MY PAYMENT TO YOUR AGENT RIGHT ....NO THEY TELL ME NO MA\\'AM WE CAN\\'T FIND WHO IT WAS WITH ...BUT THEY CAN SEE WHERE I PAID TO AN AGENT WITH A DEBIT CARD ...THEN CANCELED IT THE SAME DAY 🤔 I CALL BS ...YES I GOT IRATE AT THIS POINT AND I USE QUITE A FEW \"COLORFUL\" WORDS BECAUSE THESE PPL ARE JUST RIDICULOUSLY RUDE & FOR THE LOVE OF GOD CAN ANYBODY IN THERE SPEAK DECENT ENGLISH !!!!

The process was so simple.\\n\\nAvant\\nMassive bait and switch\\nMassive bait and switch. Received approval that showed $0 under origination fees and $10,000 as total amount to be deposited in my bank. Then before funding changed fine print that doesn\\'t display well on mobile devices. Changing terms to 10% origination fee or $999 and only depositing $9001 into account. This dramatically changed the terms to a loan that was a very very very bad deal and I never would have accepted. People like this should be thrown into prison? I didnt catch until 24 hours after they funded because they funded to the WRONG CHECKING ACCOUNT. Even after confirming through 2 diferent agents on two different calls that is was going to the correct account.\\n\\nAvant\\nApplication and Approval was easy\\nThis is the third loan I have received from Avant. The loan application was easy. The time between the approval and the issuing of funds was very quickly. The only downside that I found (for me) was the amount I was approved for was not the amount I actually received. They take out fees first. I wish they would just add it at the end. I had calculated exactly what I needed but once they took the fees out I had to come up with a different plan.\\n\\nAvant\\nIt was fast and easy\\nIt was fast and easy\\n\\nAvant\\neasy application simple process\\nDate of experience: February 09, 2024\\n\\nAvant\\n9% administrative fee for a loan that\\'s…\\n9% administrative fee for a loan that\\'s b******* that\\'s greed!\\n\\nAvant\\nJUST RECEIVED CARD & BALANCE HAS BEEN…\\nJUST RECEIVED CARD & BALANCE HAS BEEN REPORTED, CREDIT SCORE WENT DOWN 125 POINTS!!!!!!\\n\\nAvant\\nquick and easy\\nMaking a payment online was quick and easy.

I refinanced the loan. I got the new information about loan how much from what account and it never gave me a due date. I thought the new amount would be deducted the same day that it has been deducted for the previous six months. I went to store and looked like a total fool when my account was 480 dollars in the hole. I looked and seen Avant had moved my due date to the 20th and pulled the money two days earlier. When I called Avant the lady rudely informed me that the due date last month was the 20th and the 20th of this month. Zero Empathy. She ewas an ass and said it would be on the new agreement. I went back through my emails and Avant on December 19th, 2023 sent me an email outlining everything.\\nThe current balance, the additional funds, the admin fee, the new total, and the funding date. Nothing about a new due date. I am a simple person, I wish that if you were going to make changes to my automatic payment it would have been pre-approved and not done without my knowledge. Also why would you change the due date that had been previously set for half a year before. Frustrated to be in the hole for two days before payday! I know Avant doesn\\'t give a care, pass on the blame to me, even though I have been making this payment on the 22nd for six prior months. You don\\'t care because you aren\\'t having to not feed your family for two days.

Thanks again Avant.\\n\\nAvant\\nVery good company\\nI have used this company before in the past, their app is easy to navigate and shows you what you have left to pay. After a year or so of payments they usually have an offer to refinance your loan at a lower interest rate, my first loan was 27% and once refinance it was 19%. It\\'s a good option to consolidate debt I think, sure it\\'s expensive but for some people it\\'s better than watching their credit card interest bleed them to death over the years like mine was.

I then made another $100.00 payment (online) and called customer (lousy) service. As soon as someone picked up the phone the first thing I heard was my MIRANDA RIGHTS that this is attempt to collect a debt...(wait - what debt?) tolld them I had made the payment on 1/10 and another one on 2/14. They said the payment on 1/10 went to my balance and they have no record of the 2/14 payment (yet) though my back said it was already pending. explained the problem and said there is nothing they could do about the 1/10 payment because it had been made (24 HRS) to soon...WAIT WHAT?. and the the late charge will stand and that there is nothing they could do about it. Asked to talk to a supervisor, only to placed on hold for over 25 min and nothing. I have emailed them multiple times and after 2 days nothing. Told to cancel the card and would just pay if off, but that I would NOT pay either the late charge nor the annual fee since the card would not be used in the coming year. If you have a problem with them, customer service is NO help at all and emailing them is just as bad.\\n\\n\\nSupplement....\\nAfter nearly 3 weeks...Avant finally responded, all it is - is a canned response, no thoughts and still they want you to reach out to them...like I have multiple times already, and all I get is just lip service and no action. Hey AVANT...here\\'s an idea...get off you computer and act like a human and maybe, I don\\'t know...maybe call the customer. you sure expect the customer to do it and do your job.\\n\\nAvant\\nI would’ve given 5 stars but I didn’t…\\nI would’ve given 5 stars but I didn’t like that the agents kept calling me asking the same repetitive questions every other day instead of reading the notes, it was frustrating because the process could’ve been much quicker!

However, the experience turned into a nightmare from the very beginning. After receiving the card, I attempted to activate it, but it wouldn\\'t work. Despite multiple attempts through the online portal and calls to customer service, the issue remained unresolved.\\n\\nCustomer service was unhelpful and unresponsive. After waiting on hold for extended periods, I finally reached a representative who failed to activate the card and couldn\\'t explain the problem. Frustrated and unable to use the card, I decided to cancel it.\\n\\nTo my shock and dismay, the representative informed me that I was still responsible for the annual fee, even though the card never worked. They refused to waive the fee or offer any form of compensation for the inconvenience and time wasted.\\n\\nWhen I requested to speak to a manager, I was astonishingly told that they didn\\'t have one available. This lack of accountability and escalation options further highlighted the company\\'s unprofessionalism and disregard for customer concerns.\\n\\nAvoid AvantCard at all costs! Their non-functional card, poor customer service, hidden fees, and lack of accountability make them a terrible choice for anyone seeking a credit card. Be wary of their misleading offers and save yourself the frustration and financial hassle I experienced.\\n\\nAvant\\nThe application was quick and easy\\nThe application was quick and easy.

You cannot see any transactions for a month. So good luck catching fraud. I called to check my balance before I made a transaction and it\\'s not accurate. I called to see why my account was showing negative and no one could tell me any transactions or see anything on my account to even help me. The first representative told me they don\\'t post the over balance to the credit bureau and that it wasn\\'t going to hurt my credit. Same morning they reported to the credit bureau and I lost a ton of points. I called back to see what happened and they still can\\'t see anything on my account. I asked them to remove it from my report. The lady says she needs to get a supervisor but none are available. Then asks when someone can call me back . I said today asap. And then the lady says remember you can log into your account online to check on your information - but you literally can\\'t and that was part of the reason I called. Literally the worst credit card I\\'ve ever had. I wouldn\\'t recommend to anyone. For a company that\\'s supposedly giving credit cards to help build credit it seems highly negligent to not allow the card holder accurate and up to date information on their account and balances. Up to 10 days to post to your account - really!?

My recent experience in trying to pay off a loan has been incredibly frustrating. I feel it\\'s important to share my concerns.\\n\\nI started the loan repayment process seven weeks ago. Despite my efforts I\\'m still waiting for a confirmation letter in the mail confirming that the loan has been fully paid off. This delay is not just inconvenient. Also has implications for my mortgage application, which is now being unnecessarily delayed.\\n\\nI\\'ve called Avant Money times over the seven weeks to inquire about the status of the letter. Unfortunately, every time I call they inform me that the letter is \"on its way.\" The lack of a resolution and constant delays in receiving the documentation are causing me a lot of distress and inconvenience.\\n\\nIn an attempt to escalate this matter I requested a callback, from a manager. To my disappointment they informed me that it would take 48 hours for this process. Unfortunately, I still haven\\'t received any callback yet further prolonging the resolution of this issue and adding to my frustration.\\nThe customer service team, at Avant Money is incredibly inefficient and unresponsive which is completely unacceptable. This does not affect my commitments but also specifically impacts my mortgage application.\\n\\nI strongly urge Avant Money to address this problem and find a solution to the delays in providing the paperwork. This experience has not damaged my perception of Avant Money. Has also raised concerns about the dependability and effectiveness of their customer service procedures.\\n\\nI sincerely hope that my feedback prompts an examination of your customer service practices ensuring that others do not encounter difficulties, in the future.\\n\\nAvant\\nGREAT service!\\nDate of experience: January 12, 2024\\n\\nAvant\\nPrompt and fast decision\\nPrompt and fast decision, thank you\\n\\nAvant\\nNew Experience\\nFrom beginning to my first charge, I was well informed, everything was smooth and efficient\\n\\nAvant\\nThe application was easy and…\\nThe application was easy and understanding.

Would like a higher credit line! On-time statement balances paid in full for over a year!\\nHaven’t had any issues with this card. Wish it didn’t have the $39 annual fee, and it could be removed. I’m getting offers for the same card now on Credit Karma for 2% cashback, instead of 1% cashback that I’m getting now, and supposedly with a higher credit line that I have now, no annual fee, 2% cashback, but the APR is much higher. I’ve had the card for well over a year have had a few credit line increases, but still think my credit line should be much higher than it is, especially since I see what people are getting as a credit line, compared to what I have now after holding the card and paying my statement balances in full every month for well over a year. Started at $300 and it’s now at $1000 as of the other day. Feel card should have a credit line of at least $1500 - $2000. Plus, I have a great track record with WebBank! Overall it’s a great card and have recommended it to family & friends who now have the card too. Always have had a great experience, just too low of credit line.\\n\\nAvant\\nIt was literally fast and easy.\\nDate of experience: December 12, 2023\\n\\nAvant\\nSecond Chances\\nIt\\'s good to know that their are still credit card companies who are willing to work with people regardless of their credit score.

I\\'ve had a large balance on all my credit cards which I have been trying desperately to knock down, with little success. I received an offer from AVANT for a personal loan to pay my credit card debt. Although the interest rate is high, it allowed me to pay off all my credit cards and lowered my monthly payments by $400. That gives me much-needed breathing room and I can now pay more than the minimum payment on that loan to pay it off more quickly. All in all, I am very pleased with my association with AVANT.\\n\\nAvant\\nGreat Customer Service and support\\nDate of experience: November 17, 2023\\n\\nAvant\\nAvant is simple and quick\\nAvant made getting a personal loan to consolidate my credit cards a breeze.

For almost a week, her employees called me at any time they wanted, although I asked to call me at 1pm so that it would not be while I was working in the office. During the call, I can hear almost nothing, since in the background of the conversation of their employee, other conversations and other noises are constantly heard, obviously their company does not know anything about noise reduction. Every day they asked me for more and more information, they even called on Saturday and Sunday. On Sunday during the call, I asked how I could cancel this application, after which the agent still asked questions, she agreed that the additional information she requested was not needed, and said that I would need to check the status of my case in my cabinet and see if it was needed more documents. On Sunday evening I saw that more documents were needed, and on Monday I saw that my application was cancelled. When I called the company and asked why my application was canceled and how to resume it, the agent told me that I canceled my application and if I wanted, I could fill out a new form and that since 7 days had not yet passed, my application would be renewed. When I did this, I received a message that they could not provide me with a loan at this time. Terrible experience with this company!\\n\\nAvant\\nI\\'m loving my card ever since I applied…\\nI\\'m loving my card ever since I applied for it.

Well avant- said they can’t do that. And they said I can send it to another address but have to send documents to do this. This $300 credit card is not worth my time.

There were different choices at different times, such as 0%, 1%, 2% and 3% back, since I visit that site frequently. When I saw the 3% populate this last time, I registered for their soft-pull on credit, then finalized it shortly after that approval.\\n\\nThe card arrived promptly and I believe I had some issue activating online, so I used the phone and prompts to do that. I registered my account online and monitor my purchases and payments there. I made multiple purchases nearly immediately at places such as stores and online shopping, even a membership to a social website, as well as my annual phone bill (yep, I pay 1 year in advance); a wide variety of purchases.\\n\\nIn 2 statements, I’ve made 14 purchases and made 5 payments. I am set up for reoccurring automatic payments, but I don’t wait that long. Once you make a payment, if it is over the minimum due for the month, your reoccurring payment is not deducted, because the system knows you have already made that minimum payment, if the minimum is what you are set up to pay. More simply, it does not double dip if you already paid. If you set it to pay your balance, I need not explain that.\\n\\nThe only negative I can think of is that they show your purchases and payments as “pending” for at least a day, so you have to do the math yourself to determine your real balance. I’m used to a credit union where transactions are immediate. Pending means you did it, so I don’t get that.\\n\\nI have not experienced any problems at all with Avant, and I get 3% back. I’m not addressing others’ problems I’ve read about, because I haven’t had those. They email me about my account, when it is due and when I make a payment. I have replaced my debit card with this card, and I just pay it off as I would have done if I had used a debit card. That is why I make so many payments, and I wanted to make sure they take multiple payments, which they do.\\n\\nSometimes I come home from the store and make a payment for what I just bought. This basically cuts my sales tax nearly in half, as long as I pay it off every month. I make at least one payment a week. I’m used to not having a credit card, so that part is a habit to keep. I\\'ll never raise my score if I carry balances on a card, and neither will you.\\n\\nDon’t ruin your credit again by using this or any card as a luxury. Don’t buy things you couldn’t otherwise pay cash for. Don\\'t tell yourself, \"It\\'s only $19.95\", just don\\'t. Don’t limit your payments to the minimum; pay the entire balance and get used to it. If you must pay a minimum (I get that), pay more no matter how much more. There’s nothing better than looking at your account online and seeing the balance is $0 with a payment due of nothing.\\n\\nAvant\\nStraightforward easy application…\\nStraightforward easy application process. Quick turnaround time and would recommend.\\n\\nAvant\\nAmazing Loan company!\\nAmazing company! Very fast and reliable. Have used them 2 times and both fully online. I had to pull 1st loan to repair my car. A year later which is now, I applied for more money to consolidate all my debts. Applied on the 5th (thurs) of the month, online, received approval on 6th (Fri) of the month by email, also letting me know I would receive funds on the (Tues) 10th but noticed I received the money in my bank actually on Saturday, the 7th penning, then posted on the 10th. 9th Monday was a holiday. I remember my first loan was pretty fast too. So basically if I didn’t spot over the weekend I’d say from the time you apply it can be 1-4 days. I think my first loan funded by 2nd day and that’s because I had very little debts.\\n\\nAnyway I was drowning in monthly minimums so this was the best experience because now I just have 1 bill and was able to choose if I wanted long term minimum or short term.\\n\\nHighly recommend them if you need a loan! Excellent experience. I’ve never had to speak to a customer service rep. I selected autopay and now I’m all set. The 1st bill will be due exactly one month after your fund date, so mine is the 10th every month.\\n\\nHope this was helpful, I was shopping around before I applied for my second Loan but felt other companies take too long to approve you online.\\n\\nIf you want a quick turn around which is what I wanted, this company is great!\\n\\nAvant\\nIt\\'s easy to use and excepted…\\nIt\\'s easy to use and excepted everywhere I go\\n\\nAvant\\nAlways prompt and helpful\\nDate of experience: October 10, 2023\\n\\nAvant\\nExcellent customer service online App…\\nExcellent customer service online App very easy to use\\n\\nAvant\\nEverything so far is good Avant\\nEverything so far is good\\n\\nAvant\\nProcess was very easy and the overall…\\nProcess was very easy and the overall turn time was fast.\\n\\nAvant\\nQuick and easy process and funds…\\nQuick and easy process and funds available 24 hours before promised.

So far, I hate it in comparison to all of my other cards. After using the card I called to get my bill/payment information to see when my 1st bill would be due, and was told to call back during business hours. I could not obtain payment info or make a payment outside of their business hours. A few weeks later while paying bills, I realized I was now a few days late on my 1st payment.. I immediately made the payment and asked for a 1 time late payment waive explaining the reason. The representative put it the request and told me I would hear back later with a decision. Days later I received an e-mail letting me know the late fee waive was denied and to call a 1-800 number if I had further questions. I called the 1-800 # and the representative said he couldn’t help with any questions concerning this and directed me to email a separate contact.

I refinanced and saved on my monthly payment. It worked out great for me!\\n\\nAvant\\nCustomer Service Sucks\\nAfter a few years with this company, no past due payments, and finally paying it off, I was cancelled because I was no longer using the card. That caused my Credit Score to drop. The reason I didn\\'t use it was because I live in a city where there is no mail service in the city. Everyone has a PO Box. The first card was sent to that PO Box but the 2nd card never arrived. Now they tell me Avant can\\'t send a card to my PO Box.\\n\\nUPDATE: There reply is an example of their \"service\". They have my phone number, so they should call. I \"called\" their phone number and was told they couldn\\'t help me. Hence, the review. Now, they want me to call them again... so I can be told the same thing all over.\\n\\nAvant\\nEverything went smoothly and fast.\\nDate of experience: September 15, 2023\\n\\nAvant\\nQuick and easy loan approved !!!\\nDate of experience: September 18, 2023\\n\\nAvant\\nGreat app\\nEasy to follow app. It is very user friendly.\\n\\nAvant\\nQuickest loan…\\nThis is by far the quickest loan process.

I receive one pay check a month and only asked that my pay date coincide with my pay day. Avant refused to move my pay date. During the almost two years I have been a customer I have NEVER failed to make a payment on time. I only wanted to move my pay date to ensure that funds would be in my account.

My first payment is due September 25th, 2023. I downloaded the app, set up autopay and scheduled my first payment to post today. After I scheduled the payment a notification came up that said I still need to make my payment due on September 25th. The $300 dollar payment I scheduled today was for my September 25th due date. So I called customer service. AVANT CUSTOMER SERVICE IS A JOKE. I spoke to Auje. It was impossible to make any headway. She just read her printed script no matter what question I ask. She could not provide an answer because she had no clue what she was doing. This is such a reflection on the integrity of a company who has so little regard for the customer that they put little to no effort into ensuring that their employees have the skill set and are equipped with the appropriate knowledge of the product or service they represent to allow them to do their job with even minimal competence. This in no way can be the responsibility of the employee who gets the brunt of our frustration and dissatisfaction, but proof of blatantly self serving leadership. I am the customer. I deserve to be assured of the company\\'s competence, to have trust in and respect for the company I do business with.

It’s relatively easy to get someone on the phone after your card declines, so i guess thats a good thing but the support speech sounds very scripted and leads me to believe they receive these types of calls often. I wouldnt bother with this card. I wish i knew better before i accepted the offer. Probably going to close this account.\\n\\nAvant\\nI have been using Avant when I needed help financially for couple of years. It’s really a quick respond and result.

They replied saying how sorry they were and asked me to call them because they wanted a chance to make things right. I called them and the rep that answered the line had no knowledge of any reply they had sent to me and went further on to say to just disregard the response, because they don\\'t really intend for people to act on the responses when they reply to reviews left by customers, they just reply so it looks good for the company. I asked for a supervisor and of course, none was available. Again, I say this company is a SCAM. They have a lot of hidden and made up fees and never acknowledge their mistakes. They are lairs and I would not encourage anyone to do business with them. I have also contacted the BBB and the news, so hopefully their unlawful practices will be brought to the light soon and the company will be shut down.\\n\\nAvant\\nGreat!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\nDate of experience: August 21, 2023\\n\\nAvant\\nGreat service great customer service…\\nGreat service great customer service lovely card\\n\\nAvant\\nAvant Helped Me Pay Off Debt and Boost My Credit\\nI wanted to share my positive experience with Avant and how it has made a significant impact on my financial journey.\\n\\nAvant\\'s services have allowed me to successfully pay off my debt, consolidate various payments, and even boost my credit score.\\n\\nIt\\'s been truly impressive to witness the positive changes that their platform has brought into my financial life.\\n\\nAvant has provided me with the necessary tools and support to regain control over my finances.\\n\\nAvant\\nThey are always polite. .An do there job well an fast\\nThey are always polite, they know there job an do it well an fast..Never have had any trouble with calling..Al though I wish I could of gotten more then a 500 dollar increase..lol..All an all I am very happy with your employees\\n\\nAvant\\nEasy to apply and get approved!\\nDate of experience: August 07, 2023\\n\\nAvant\\nI have had a fraud issue for more then…\\nI have had a fraud issue for more then 3,weeks and nothing has been resolved\\n\\nAvant\\nHigh interest but better payments than…\\nHigh interest but better payments than what I was making.

The plan was selected by the Avant customer service rep. They told me this was what I would have to pay and I would be caught up which I agreed to. I was told my card would stay open and in good standing as well. They also told me there would be interest charges but was not advised that I would also be charged late fees. I was charged for late fees in June, July and August because it was considered late and I didn’t pay enough to cover the past due. How is that when the customer service rep was the one who told me what payment plan would catch me up? I tried calling to get the late fees waived as it was $39/month. The customer service rep was rude and tried yelling at me, was cutting me off and put me on hold for more than 5 mins at a time. Nothing got resolved. I was told they would “file “ a claim for me to get the late fee “refunded” if approved and today I received an email that it was denied.\\n\\nThis is definitely unlawful practice and as I mentioned I was never once warned about late fees. The dates the payments were automatically withdrawn were the dates an Avant rep picked for me stating it would help me get caught up.\\n\\nI asked to speak to a manager and not one manager came on the phone.\\n\\nI’d like to speak to someone who can assist and is professional enough to get these late fees cleared up.\\n\\nAvant\\nI just received my new credit card and…\\nI just received my new credit card and clicked on the blue hyperlink in the email to activate it I did that about five times it wouldn\\'t activate I even went to the app and it wouldn\\'t activate so I ended up having to manually call the 800 number to activate extremely inconvenient!\\n\\nAvant\\nExcellent customer service\\nDate of experience: August 05, 2023\\n\\nAvant\\nAvant is the great company\\nAvant is the great company, why? made easy to apply online, when you need it, and the process is short time, to get it all you need...

I don\\'t carry balances, the money I used was in my checking account, therefore I could have used my bank account to pay for the services, that I used the card for. I used the card, because that\\'s what its for. Normally banks report your unpaid balances after both the due date and next statement when you\\'ve paid your balance, not the very first statement. If I haven\\'t been given a due date, how can I even pay it.when. You made it seem to credit bureaus I carry a balance, and I don\\'t. This lowered my score 12 points!!! Moral of the story wait til your first statement comes out, and you have a due date, before you use this card for any purchases.\\n\\nAvant\\nEasy to do business with .\\nEasy to do business with .\\nProfessional. 5 star service.\\n\\nAvant\\nGreat company to build your credit…\\nGreat company to build your credit with.

They charge the interest all up front and there\\'s no way to get out of it. They will not answer questions about this over email, they will tell you that you can pay early to avoid interest but that\\'s not true. You will still be responsible for it. If you want to get a direct answer you have to call and I spoke to someone super rude. Do not get a loan through them.\\n\\nAvant\\nRegrets Already\\nI haven\\'t even gotten my card yet snd already regretting signing up for it after seeing reviews about having a different time speaking with someone, activating the card, unknown transactions on the card before even getting the card and unexpected drops on your balance after getting approved for a higher amount.

Be warned that if you do you will have no end to fees even when you pay in full . They call it trailing interest fees! Then you have to talk to someone who is a racist and hates american people real nice 👍. They lie about you paying you paying your balance in full. They complained that they don’t take responsibility for their employees mistakes and they have to get approval just to remove a fee that they made the mistake of doing. I have paid in full owes training fees and they just accumulate ans this company doesn’t get that it’s the principle not the amount of money which was very insignificant. Thank you very much. I will never recommend a company like yours for anyone not even my worse enemy! Mastercard, capital one all the way .

We it is now Monday the of the week after I was to be called and still haven\\'t be contacted. I just called again and got customer service who 100% refused to transfer me to the fraud department because no one has yet been assigned my case. So if you are looking for customer service if needed this is definitely not the company for you.

We made one charge on the account & we didn’t get our merchandise. So we disputed the charge. This was 12/2021! Still nothing! Every month we would call & explain everything over & over. No one calls back, no response to emails & so on. I don’t know how the Federal agencies haven’t fined them or gave them a violation for this.

Easy payments.\\n\\nAvant\\nCustomer Service is a Nightmare\\nI was pre-approved for a loan and lady who helped me with my application over the phone was very kind walking me through it. She stated that decisions on pre-approved accounts are instant but it would take at most 24 hours. I am now on day 5 of trying to get this \"pre-approved\" loan done but they keep making me go through hurdles. I presented all bank states, pay stubs, offer letter, and they pulled my credit with a hard inquiry. But they still can\\'t decide if I should have it so I should talk to the IRS about my income being tracked for 2023. This isn\\'t possible by the way but they insisted that I call the IRS now for prove me wrong. Well it\\'s a holiday weekend so no one is available until Tuesday. They proceeded to state that I won\\'t have a decision then until next Friday at the earliest and berated me on the phone about not knowing how this works. Ridiculous waste of a hard credit hit for a loan I cancelled due to their bait & switch tactics.\\n\\nAvant\\nSo Thankful for helping me in the time of Need.appreciate the turn around time and customer service .\\nThe company is professional .There turn around time is amazing .The Rep was very kind and willing to get the job done\\n\\nAvant\\nAmazing card\\nI will start by saying that Avant surprised me this is one card that would never let go a bit high interest but worthy and easy to see information and good protection there is other cards that can’t even trust by given high credit but Avant does and so far I have a good experience\\n\\nAvant\\nA streamlined process!\\nAvant helped make this a streamlined, pain-free process in order to get the help I needed to continue with my debt consolidation plan.\\n\\nAvant\\nAdjustment and assessment.\\nWell, your lending is based on my credit history because I need funds to run my business but I am great for what you are lending it I won\\'t let you down. i fully understand how credit work is my everyday mission is to learn more.\\n\\nAvant\\nWould Recommend\\nI was able to be approved for a loan with good terms included.

The phone operators pronunciation was well recorded. You could understand her words easily. She also made things quick and simple. So Avant is great so far but I have yet to make a payment. That’s why I only gave you four stars..\\n\\nAvant\\nTrustworthy and Helpful From Start To Finish\\nI felt so comfortable using Avant for my financial needs. Everything was made easy. All fees were presented upfront and the fact that I could choose a repayment plan that best suited me, and not Avant, was especially great. I used a debt consolidation loan that has not only improved my credit score, but will also allow me to save money by being able to pay off credit cards that had varying interest rates. This means that my loan from Avant will be paid off quicker than balances on my individual credit cards. Definitely recommend!\\n\\nAvant\\nGreat customer service\\nEasy use!

I applied for a 2000.00 loan through Avant because it was the 1st options out of 3 on Credit Karma with my credit score being Trans 698 and Equ 700 and Exp 689. EVERY!! document that was required was sent in with the help of 1 of the C.Service Rep.. at the end of the day I was told There was NOTHING else needed from me. But check with my Dash board from time to time just in case. I did that. Nothing was asked if me to submit.I would be notify within 24hrs a decision of Approval or denied. Well i had confidence that I would get approved being Credit Karma BASED these Loan Agencies by my Credit score. Well I called the next day for a follow up and spoke to a Khaleel and by the way she spoke to me I KNEW she had it out for me. I hate to say it but I was treated like she didn’t like the color of my skin. So yes you guessed it I was unfortunately not able to receive the funds lol. So you mean to tell me I can get a card through APPLE.. a Bank that’s great but denied through Avant and their bank of choice. WOW! it said that I have 60 days to submit a form asking what was the decision made to Why I was denied. Yes I WANT THAT FORM. I just want to see what was the reason why I was denied. Be careful with this company.AND Credit Karma at this point I think they are running some kind of scam to get ppls information.

After this point I called Avant customer service i paid my balance in full and requested my account to be closed (here comes the funny part) they Accept my payment in (Full) and after they Cleared the payment , they then proceed to ask me what\\'s the reason I\\'m closing the account and after I gave them the reason they didn\\'t even make an attempt to waive my annual fee for me to stay, which I wasn\\'t going to but this speaks highly of this company Further more they overcharged me in the process of closing my account and now i must wait 2-3 weeks for their mistake .

I was asked the same set of questions, and answered the same set of questions three different times over about a week long period! And after each set of questions I was asked, I was led to believe that my funds would be deposited into my bank account either later that day, or by the next day. It happened 3 different times and I was told to expect funds at least by the next day, three different times! It was like starting over each time I called, checking to see what the holdup was? The customer service team was very pleasant, but there was unnecessary aggravation there as well, due to very thick accents from an off-shore customer service team! As I said before, they were very nice, but they are trained to repeat literally every word that a customer says to them, after each sentence. It’s so annoying and makes communication take twice as long, which is an unnecessary waste of time & causes much aggravation! I actually started thinking that they had lost my original loan application or something because I had to verbally reapply every time I called. I almost canceled and went with another bank because of this, but the last time I called , they assured me that I’d be receiving funds by the next morning, which I did, so no harm done. However there was definitely more aggravation than there had to be. I received a fair rate (for 2023) on my unsecured bill consolidation loan considering the interest rates and market conditions of today! Which is of course insanely high, but it is what it is in 2023.\\n\\nAvant\\nWhat a great experience\\nDate of experience: March 23, 2023\\n\\nAvant\\nFunds were fast\\nFunds were fast, simple, customer service great\\n\\nAvant\\nEasy to apply\\nEasy to apply and getting funds was fast, allowing me to pay off high interest credit cards.\\n\\nAvant\\nRespectful and courtesy\\nDate of experience: March 10, 2023\\n\\nAvant\\nI try to paid for my nails that was a…\\nI try to paid for my nails that was a total amount off $100.00 and it was declined\\n\\nAvant\\n1st yes\\neasy activation and use\\n\\nAvant\\nVery easy and fast process\\nVery easy and fast process.

Prior to the bank closing, I reported a charge to my account that was over a thousand dollars that were not made by me.

I contact the establishment this charge was made and they agreed that since the charge was clearly not made by me that they would like to return the money but would have needed to return it to the account that was used, which was this now closed account. A week later I received an email from Avant stating that they received the money and would be sending me a check in the mail. This was 3 months ago. I call weekly and am told that they don\\'t have a partnership with some other bank and cant send me a check until they have one. I can\\'t believe this! After never even investigating charges I dispute, they are now holding my money. Is this even legal?

The next month I get a bill for $3.63 for interest on the balance because they do daily balance to charge interest and there was 11 days between the beginning of the new cycle and when they received payment. They refused to wave it and I told them that was petty after sending them almost $400 the previous month and that I refuse to pay. The next month they send me a bill for the interest and then a late fee. I just started getting back to fair credit again after a similar fight with BLAZE (which I reviewed here) and they\\'re trashing my score over $7. This company is petty and charges interest even after the account is closed. They could have waved the interest and; thus, not charge me a late fee but they want to ruin people over chump change.\\n\\nAvant\\nThank you so much for giving me the…\\nThank you so much for giving me the opportunity to make things happen, you will be paid back in full very appreciated.\\n\\nAvant\\nDon\\'t know yet\\nDate of experience: March 03, 2023\\n\\nAvant\\nI was truly blessed to be given a large…\\nI was truly blessed to be given a large credit line...

It was also nice that they offer to refinance at a lower rate once you\\'ve paid your loan down. It\\'s easy.

All I needed was a new card sent out because I never received the previous one and I kept being placed on hold and was transferred to a new representative more than once who would then ask me the same questions before my call was disconnected when I was being transferred again. They also gave me a hard time about requesting a new card because it had been 27 days since they sent out a previous card and not 30 and said that I could possibly still receive the card. I told them NO! Just send me a new card! It took 6 people to finally get a new card sent out to me! RIDICULOUS!\\n\\nAvant\\nAmazingly Fast\\nAmazing, within minutes I was approved for the loan designed for me with reasonable payment plan that fit my budget.

False advertising at its finest and probably the worst customer service I’ve ever experienced. I’m not sure why every worker barely speaks any English and literally reads off the exact same script word for word instead of giving an actual educated answer or doing SOMETHING to help the customer. “Qualify same day and get financed within 1-3 business days”. It’s been 5 and my application has still not been processed despite contacting over FIVE customer service Agents. Each reading some scripted response instead of actually doing their job. Was told repeatedly “we don’t need anything further” “your application is still being looked over”- yet getting daily emails asking for the SAME documents to be sent over and over again. Not only does this company lie and advertise falsely- they’re full of incompetent employees as well. You’d think I was trying to get the money from each representatives pay check the way they’ve basically have refused to help. I have never witness such a dysfunctional loan company! Wouldn’t recommend using them if they were the only people that ever qualified you. HORRIBLE experience and still ongoing, still without reason, still without talking to someone with a brain, and STILL have yet to have a manager call me.\\n\\nAvant\\nGood Experience\\nThe process was friendly, instructional, and streamlined.

What is the point of having this card if you can\\'t use it? Every attempted transaction is deemed to be FRAUD, when it\\'s not.\\n\\nOn February 11, I tried to use this card at a place where I am a regular. I was publicly embarrassed to have it declined. So I used another card to pay my tab.\\n\\nThe next day, I tried to use it at an online delivery app. Declined again. I got an email asking me to call to verify that I made the listed charges. I called, spent forever on hold, and the call got cut off. Called again and finally got the issue solved and my card unfrozen. I thought that was the end of it.\\n\\nNope. On Monday, February 20, I tried to use it again with the same delivery app. Declined. Tried again at a different retailer to see if maybe the delivery app was the problem, but declined AGAIN. Now they want me to call AGAIN to fix it.\\n\\nI understand wanting to protect customers from fraud, but this is BEYOND RIDICULOUS. I have to waste hours calling you every time I want to use this card? No. Not gonna happen. Fix the system on your end, don\\'t waste my time making me fix problems that were not my fault. I\\'ve been a good customer, always make my payments on time, I don\\'t deserve to be treated like a criminal.\\n\\nAnd don\\'t bother with your canned response telling me to call again. The answer is NO. How do I know that this won\\'t be the end of it? You have issues on your end, fix it and maybe I will remain a customer. As it is now, i will pay this thing down and then it\\'s good riddance. You can\\'t treat honest customers this way and expect them to remain customers.\\n\\nAvant\\nEasy to work with\\nEasy to do business with.\\n\\nAvant\\nSupper fast.

Thank you\\n\\nAvant\\nUnauthorized changes to credit card…\\nUnauthorized changes to credit card account\\nI have had this Avant card for less than a year and without my knowledge or consent, they made the decision to raise the credit limit which 1) had an impact on my credit score and 2) made it appear as if I was shopping for additional credit WHICH I WAS NOT. When I called the company to inquire why I was never notified that the credit limit either was going to be increased or had been increased, the first customer \"service\" representative could only read some scripted answer which did not address the question. Then he transferred me to a RUDE and CONDESCENDING \"supervisor\" who read the same script and hung up on me. I am paying off the $280 I owe these people and never using this card again. They are horrible people to do business with.\\n\\nResponse to AVANT response: You didn\\'t bother to even read the review. The unauthorized CHANGE (not CHARGE - pay attention) was made to the account with notification either before it took place or after. I found out from a credit bureau.

Not right to give one interest rate after a credit review then have a much much higher rate before the money was released. Just saying if it happens to anyone else I\\'d like to know about it.\\n\\nMoney was deposited quickly, and approval was smooth. After my credit file review I was offered a low rate in the beginning which was the major factor in my decision to take the offer. Once Avant proceeded they stated they was unable to give me the lower rate, that they would offer me a higher interest with apologies. Well they done hit my credit with the first offer so I took what they offered in hopes to move the loan soon.\\n\\nAvant\\nHappy Customer😎\\nI had a great experience with your company, the associates were I spoke with were very friendly and professional!

Referred several people already!!\\n\\nAvant\\nNot trusted. Don’t give your personal info\\nI wouldn’t recommend this company. I applied for a small loan, and during my application process, I uploaded all requested documents the same day on the portal. After uploading the documents, I received a green boxing stating “completed”. Everyday after I would either receive an email that said “please call AVANT” or upload a document in which I had already upload. This went on for 6 days, each day I would call and speak to different representatives, informing them all that I had completed those task. They would confirm with me that was accurate and told me “we will process your application and approval could can taken place within the same 24hrs.” This was my same scenario every day for 6 days. On day 7, I received an email stating that my application had expired and I would have to re-apply. In disbelief I contacted Avant and the representative pretty much read my email to me, before I could even speak to tell her why I was calling. I informed her I would like to know why they dropped they ball? Why did they send the same emails to me daily with task I had already completed. When I asked for a supervisor, I was told they were on the phone with someone else and the representative would schedule a call back for the supervisor to call me… That call back never happened. Please don’t waste your time with this company, please don’t give them your personal information and then receive a soft or hard pull on your credit. They acted as amateurs or a scamming company. I would’ve gave them zero stars if I could have.\\n\\nAvant\\nthe process was smooth and quick\\nDate of experience: January 23, 2023\\n\\nAvant\\nHonoring the Contract\\nDate of experience: January 24, 2023\\n\\nAvant\\nSuper quick and efficient process!\\nDate of experience: January 24, 2023\\n\\nAvant\\nI am happy for approving my personal…\\nI am happy for approving my personal loan.

Thank you\\n\\nAvant\\nThis company is very unprofessional and…\\nThis company is very unprofessional and seems far from legit. I spoke to a representative and he told me that even after I closed my account I had over $300 in late fees with interest. He then transferred me and then it kept hanging up, everytime I tried to get another representative. Don’t ever use them. They have no sympathy for their mistakes.\\n\\nAvant\\nAvant is awesome!\\nAfter filing for bankruptcy in 2018, I didn’t think of taking out another loan. Avant accepted me and gave me a chance to perform. They have flexible terms. I picked three years at 21% finance charge. The process was quick and easy. Within a few days I received my funds. I will definitely do business with them again in the future!\\n\\nAvant\\nPredators\\nThis company is not just shady, they are predatory. I closed an account with them in Aug/Sept of 2022 and paid my remaining balance at that time. It appeared everything was done professionally and without hassle.\\nFast forward to Jan 2023...I received an email telling me my statement was ready. I was confused, but checked it out. When I discovered a supposedly unpaid balance as well as two late fees and interest I was angry and disappointed. The 38 minute phonecall didn\\'t resolve anything so now I must wait 48 hours for a supervisor to respond.\\nI will keep posting updates here, but I am certain it will be challenging to get a fair resolution.\\nAVANT is a horrific company that takes advantage of customers at every opportunity.\\nI look forward to never doing business with them again.\\n\\n1/9/23 no call from Avant and no, I will not call the number they posted on the cut/paste reply just to be left on hold indefinitely.\\n\\nAvant\\nThis is a terrible card and these…\\nThis is a terrible card and these reviews only solidify my comment. They have no automated teller, you have to call and pay bill during their business hours which is not very accommodating, I paid all my bills but put this one aside to pay on their time causing me to forget to pay it. This month realizing what I did paid both months, I spoke to a person about taking the notice to the credit borough ofF he said no, why not ? My perfect payment on my cards for the last 7 years has been blemished but this card. I cut the card up and will never use it again after paid off. Don\\'t get this card it a hassle to pay it, the service is terrible.\\n\\nAvant\\nDon’t be tricked and they don’t really care…\\nI opened my card in July 2022 and like others was given a $2k credit limit. I had an okay credit score of 650 and make $130k a year and was doing great rebuilding my credit. This company arbitrarily decides it should lower my credit to $750 from $2k after a “review of my credit”. I called and inquired and customer service they had no reason and that department who makes the decision can’t take calls. Do you believe this?? I close my account right then and there. I had a $427 balance on what was a $2k credit line and now a $750. My debt to loan ratio was killed.\\n\\nThe next month my credit score drops to 602. This company screwed me over. Fast forward to 5 days before Christmas and I receive this email:\\n_______________________________________\\n\\nWe recently advised you of a credit line decrease on your account that was based in whole or in part on a low behavior score.

Great business ethics and way to treat the customer.\\n\\nBeware of Avant and tread lightly\\n\\nAvant\\nScam\\nScam, i applied through Credit Karma was preapproved and went through submitting documents. they requested another set of documents to verify my income and after two days my application \"EXPIRED\" saying that it was not reviewed in time. They ask me to reapply but then when i did they are giving me new terms, higher APR and higher interest rates and longer term to pay for the loan. they say that it will no do another credit pull on me but yeah. why can you offer the same terms that i choose initially. They are putting people in a situation that they dont have a choice but to bite on the higher APR and interest rates because of their ow fault of not reviewing the application in time which looks like intentional for the application to expire.\\n\\nAvant\\nVery Efficient\\nEase of process, communication throughout the process, and a user-friendly site!\\n\\nAvant\\nHORRIBLE card\\nHORRIBLE card, awful, rude customer service. Deceased my credit limit out of the blue after only having the card a few months, which put me over my \"new limit\". Very shady business practices, 0/10 do NOT recommend.

Application process and notification was smooth and quick.\\n\\nAvant\\nSTAY AWAY - THE WORST COMPANY EVER !\\nI received a Credit card from Avant ( WEBBANK ) and had a $3000 credit limit. I used the card 1 time and charged a whole $30. I paid it off in full, then I was notified my Credit limit was dropped to $300 for adverse actions on my account??? I called customer service - they were absolutely Useless - they could not help, so I cancelled my card.\\n\\nI just received and email letting my know that reducing my credit line was an error on their part, but since I cancelled my card with them, there is nothing they can do. It took them 2 months to figure out they screwed up ????\\n\\nThe worst experience I have ever had with a credit card company. They should never be allowed to deal with finances.\\n\\nI am sure they will respond and say \" oh we are so sorry, please call customer service and we will help \" - I can assure you, their customer service is 100% USELESS\\n\\nSTAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY.\\n\\nUPDATE. As I predicted, Avant responded with the same canned message they use here for everyone who has had a horrible experience. I also did call them back and guess what, they said they cannot help.

In 30 days I get a 60 day late. I call again and basically get it\\'s not out problem you got charged for trailing interest.

I supplied every document they asked for, some more than once. I carefully explained how each income worked, but everytime I called, I got a different agent and had to explain again. The company did not like that I had 2 different banks and one of my part time jobs paid in paper checks. I can\\'t tell you how many times I was hung up on when I would call to check on my application. They would NOT accept the second job as a second income without being able to prove where I deposited the checks. My credit is fair but trending upward, every payment on time and remarks are all postiive on my credit report. Isn\\'t the point of applying for a consolidation personal loan to consider what the clients are trying to do...get out of debt with the least amount of interest charges and lowering your DTI?! Just say no, and go elsewhere.\\n\\nAvant\\nDo not deal with this company!!\\nDo not deal with this company!!! It is a trap! You pay your balance in full and then they charge you .10 on next statement (which was never received) and then when you get hit with a late charge and call to find out what it’s for because you paid off in full plus closed account they inform you of the .10 charge. Now you pay balance again and they inform you there may still be money owed next month. How???\\n\\nAvant\\nThis company gave me a credit line of…\\nThis company gave me a credit line of 1500 and because I had to use up to 1000 they dropped my limit by 500 the following month..how did they know that I wouldn’t have paid off the balance before they went ahead and lowered it ..they didn’t give me a chance to to that ..why give me a certain amount to use and then drop me for using it you might have seen it all paid ..I don’t suggest this card to anyone in fact I only had the card for 3 months ..they obviously don’t give you a chance to show your credit worthiness..so when the limit drops I effected my total limit on my report..wow thanks ..I won’t be using this card ever again now that I have paid it off.. be weary of how they drop your limit the first time that go a little high on your limit after all isn’t that what a credit card is for..well maybe not with this company.. garbage of a company!!!\\n\\nAvant\\nno problems with the loan\\nno problems with the loan! but I forgot my old phone # and had to call.\\n\\nAvant\\nYou helped when I needed it most.\\nYou helped when I needed it most.\\nThank you\\n\\nAvant\\nThe refinancing went smoothly\\nThe refinancing went smoothly.

FRAUD! I paid my account in full on 10/4/22. Payment Posted in my bank account 10/5/22. Avant received the payment and it posted, the account was closed down 10/6/22. Avant sent me an email confirming the account was closed down at my request. Without my knowledge! Avant did not close my account and on 10/17/22. Avant charged me $11.06 in interest on a account that was closed down on 10/6/22 on a $0 balance. Avant did not report my account closed until 10/20/22. Thinking this was an error! I contact Avant and had to deal with the most incompetent, uneducated, rude, lack of empathy, and disrespectful employees in my life! I got hung up on multiple times! The Supervisor Shaniece hung up on us was stand offish forgetting her ghetto attitude is not allowed at a place of business. My wife and I got hung up on multiple times by majorityof the time! I was advise it will take the company 14 days to respond to my complaint and it will be by email. The payment is due in 8 days on account that shouldn\\'t exist. This payment they want it not much but it\\'s the principally of them forcing and bullying me into paying, I believe because I closed my account. The reason I closed my account is because i felt the company was the weakest link amongst all my credit cards and before this i had 3 other horrible interactions which lead to me closing my account, the right way, paying my balance in full. I would highly recommend using another company for your financial needs. They claim all these calls are recorded so they can pull up them to confirm everything I\\'ve mentioned here!\\n\\n\\nUpdate: 11/15/2022\\nAvants response is an automated response! If Avant checked their records! They\\'d see i already did that multiple times and got a bullsh!t response supporting their decision. Their response below is to satisfy the person reading the review to assume Avant is on top of their customer complaints. They did nothing and told me they will do nothing! I was forced to pay their fraud charges or it would impact my credit score and my \"never missed a payment\".

I\\'m paying my bill and looking elsewhere for a credit card\\n\\n\\nIn reply to Avant...\\nYou didn\\'t address the issue here. The point is my credit limit was decreased unknowingly without an email or phone call. On top of that your customer service was not able to give me an answer as to why.

Communication was always open with the representative.\\n\\nAvant\\nAVOID AT ALL COSTS\\nWhere do I start? I had a $0 balance at the end of October because I paid in full. My statement cut on November 1 and shows I have an interest charge of $6.08 cents on a statement close balance of $0. How do you charge interest on $0 balance??? To make matters worse, they also reduced my credit limit what they call “behavior score too low\". I have a 701 TU FICO, 688 EXP, and 690 Equifax. Several other credit cards have raised my limit in the last month alone. I paid off in full and closed the account as of today. STAY AWAY from this card and WebBank in general.\\n\\nAvant\\nShady business\\nAs I was in the process of trying to leave a review the very first one I saw was my exact same experience. This is the shadiest credit company EVER. They set me up with a $3000 limit in August and because I don’t use the account often I received a letter stating that my limit was dropped to $300. The only reason why I got it was for my total available credit to increase. I am below 20% but wanted it lower since I am trying to buy a house. They also pulled my credit again without my permission. I closed my account and will be filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau. Save your time and don’t apply with them.\\n\\nAvant\\nDon’t have time for credit card games like this\\nReduced my credit limit for what they call “frequency of overlimit activity”. Never went over my limit with this card or any others that I have. In fact, other credit cards raise my limit periodically. Tried emailing with no response. No one can tell you anything on the phone. I paid off in full and closed the account. Avant is not just one bank (web bank) but a group of lenders. I would stay away from this card or any other card associated with “web bank” in the future.\\n\\nAvant\\nPretty dirty to collect down payment then reduce limit for no reason\\nI\\'ve had this card since August 2022. Was approved for $3000. Yesterday I logged in to find I\\'ve been reduced to $300. I find this amount basically useless. I have emailed customer support and haven\\'t heard anything. They collected my down payment and reduced the credit limit with no notice and absolutely no reason. I haven\\'t even had time to use the card. I will be closing this account because it wasn\\'t worth the down payment to be reduced to $300 from $3000.\\n\\nAvant\\nVery simple\\nVery simple.

They also are very rude and won\\'t help you take care of shutting your card down. Don\\'t waste your time!.. Just so you all know.. The people that are giving them a 5 star rating was \"invited\".. The ones giving them a bad rating has not been invited to give a review... Just an observation.\\n\\nAvant\\nStay Away From Avant\\nStay Away From Avant. I was a avant card holder with a 3k credit limit, never used near the limit, paid the bill in full early and with no notice I seen online my credit limit was reduced to $300, after confirming with customer service it was not an error I asked why and was told there was no reason but that they can do this, so I decided to close the account and the rep actually asked me why I was closing the account, my reply was I don\\'t need a reason just as you didn\\'t need a reason to cut my limit. Evidentally this is common business for this company as I have read several reviews from people that had the same thing happen to them recently.\\n\\nAvant\\nQuick and easy application\\nQuick and easy application. Fast approval and funds.\\n\\nAvant\\nI have had an Avant credit card for seven years.\\nI have had an Avant credit card for seven years. In that time, they have never increased my credit limit from the $300 initial limit I received when I got the card even though I have never missed a payment and have always paid more than the minimum. In the meantime, I have received other cards from much larger companies with better reputations who have given much higher credit limits (after an initial lower limit) which I maintain and pay each month without issue! Don\\'t bother with this high interest card that does nothing for you in the long run!! Mine will be cancelled as soon as it is paid off! (Which is not long from now.)\\n\\nAvant\\nTerrible customer service\\nTerrible customer service. Will not remove 2 fraudulent charges from my account. I have had to hire an attorney because shelbi from fruad department refuses to call me back after 18 messages I\\'ve left. Hopefully when they find out they are being sued because of her she is fired. Can\\'t wait till they get the subpoena for the lawsuit. All over less than 100 and now they will spend thousands on attorneys fees and will pay my attorney when I win. They will not fix anything. Stay far away from them\\n\\nAvant\\nEasy application didn\\'t take long and…\\nEasy application didn\\'t take long and was deposited into my account when I was told\\n\\nAvant\\nAbsolutely horrible\\nAbsolutely horrible. I had a $3000 line. My balance was high, right around 2800. I\\'ve made all my payments on time, and then a few days ago I went ahead and paid it off so we\\'d have credit for our upcoming wedding as well as to increase my score because im getting ready to buy a house. I logged in today and not only did they take my 2800 payment, they immediately decreased my line to 300. I sold a beloved family possession to pay this off and now I\\'m heartbroken that I seemed to have done it for no reason. They refuse to tell me why and only said \"you\\'ll receive a letter\". Absolutely terrible that they can do this on a whim, especially to customers who never miss payments. This will end up decreasing my credit score to a point that I\\'ll not be eligible for my home loan now and we are likely going to end up in the streets soon. I\\'ll be immediately closing this account. DO NOT GET THIS CARD!\\n\\nAvant\\nFrustrating, but I was approved…\\nThe customer service isn’t the best and I was getting frustrated and thought that they were wasting my time and I wouldn’t receive the loan, but I was approved and received the loan.

Stay far away from this bogus company.\\n\\nAvant\\nMy loan approval was painless and to…\\nMy loan approval was painless and to the point, received my funds quickly right into my bank account as they said, just in time for our new roof we needed badly.\\nYou saved us Avant, thank you.\\n\\nAvant\\nSo easy to get help you need!\\nAvant made my experience easy and quick to process and get the $$$ I needed in comparison to other companies that make you jump through hoops to even get started...Highly recommend !!\\n\\nAvant\\nApproval was instant and funds were…\\nApproval was instant and funds were deposited in a timely manner.\\n\\nAvant\\nThis card company is useless they give…\\nThis card company is useless they give you a credit limit and you use it. Oh no you cannot use it. They decrease your credit limit because you used it that is so stupid. What else are you supposed to do with a credit card if it’s there if you need to use it, so what if you use it especially if you pay it right back this card is stupid and its useless.\\n\\nAvant\\nFast response\\nFast response. Loan application easy to read. The lengthy time before payment is due. The ability to pay off early without penalties.\\n\\nAvant\\nIf you are looking for a great loan…\\nIf you are looking for a great loan experience look no further. Honestly I got my money quickly and the process is straight forward. Just upload your documents and get your money fast. I had a high internet credit card thanks to Avant- I took care of it.\\n\\nAvant\\nFraudulent and misleading\\nI opened up a card account with Avant and started with a $1,500 credit limit. I used it for travel and car rental. My last trip I used $1,400 of my available credit and when I returned home I paid the balance in full before the statement period ended. As, I was preparing for my most recent trip. I attempted to use my card to reserve a car and that\\'s when I learned my available credit had been decreased to $300 with no notice or justification. I\\'ve NEVER been late or missed a payment.\\nSo, there was no reason for the decrease or the embarrassment that I was put through. I see from other comments, this is a normal practice of AVANT. This company is a fraud and misleading when having you apply. DO NOT APPLY for a card with them. When they do this it DIRECTLY IMPACTS your credit negatively!!! I\\'ll certainly close my account and stop doing business with this unethical company. I\\'ll also contact the BBB and the states Attorney Generals office. I encourage those with similar experiences to do the same.\\n\\nAvant\\nWhat most impressed me was how quick…\\nWhat most impressed me was how quick the process went. No hassles.

Avant made my loan easy and made me know were on same page. i had late payments in the past years, currently one debts and was denied a $6000 loan.

STAY AWAY\\nThey started me off with $1,500 credit limit. I have always paid my bill early. I went to make a purchase and it got declined. I looked at my account and they lowered my limit substantially. No one ever told me anything. Then I call \"customer service\" after 10 minutes on phone the guy said he couldn\\'t help me and for me to email customer service. I emailed customer service and they told me by their records it was handled over the phone. No communication at all!! I am paying off my account and closing it. They are horrible. They want me to call or email to resolve this issue. I tried that originally and got no where. They do NOT communicate with people.

I had a 1500 credit limit. I ALWAYS paid my balance in time, either in full or over half, every month. Yesterday I logged on to make a payment only to discover they had dropped my credit limit from 1500 to 300. That is INSANE. If anything I should have been given an increase for ALWAYS using my credit responsibly and NEVER being late. They\\'ve actually just hurt my credit with their actions. Pretty sad to do that to someone who has been a responsible user and never been late in payments. I closed my account which is also going to hurt my credit, but I guess it\\'s better than being involved with a company that has no values. Good riddance.\\n\\nAvant\\nmy payment went through 3 days early-…\\nmy payment went through 3 days early- when i called to see why- it took 3 calls because the line kept getting disconnected. finally when i spoke to someone she informed me that because my scheduled payment day was on a monday- they would of course take out the funds on friday??? the call center is overseas so needless to say i just had a lot of \" i do understand your frustration \" \"but unfortunately\" with no resolution. this is only my 2nd payment so it does feel like a shame that i would have a negative experience so early.\\n\\nAvant\\nGood customer service\\nDate of experience: October 05, 2022\\n\\nAvant\\nHad a $1500 credit line with them I…\\nHad a $1500 credit line with them I always make sure I pay on time and I’m pretty good about paying off the balance in full with a month discovered they reran my credit 6 months in and cut my credit line in half a week ago as such I’m canceling my card in 2 weeks when I pay off the current balance.

When I called to ask about it I was told they would have to check my credit to see if they could increase it instead they cut my credit limit in half and I made my payment and they refunded it. Don’t know what I’m talking about they did not refund my payment. Also when I make a payment on auto bill pay it takes them 3 week to post payment and try to charge late payment fee. Tried to talk to a supervisor told no and hung up on me. There web page advertisement personalized service. Beware\\n\\nAvant\\nHorrible Experience, Stay Away!\\nI would give negative stars if I could. This card has TERRIBLE customer service. They sent an email offering help to those of us hit by Hurricane Ian, in the form of no late fees. I called to confirm this and ask to skip the payment for October, to which the agent said I could. I skip the payment and am immediately inundated with late payment emails. I call again and the first person I spoke to told me I hadn’t made my August payment and that was why I was getting the emails. I made two payments in July, one on the first for July and one on the 29th for August. Then, when I got a supervisor on the phone, he told me my September AND October payments were late and I told him I was looking at my statements and September was paid on the 3rd. He refused to uphold what the agent that had told me about being able to skip the payment. Thanks for not assessing late fees, but no thanks for the late payment mark on my credit score. I will pay this garbage card off as soon as I can and get rid of it.

Made a very big mistake by applying for this card just know that in a time of need or natural disaster they will not help you as they will tell you that it goes against company policy to help you out with any late fees as such Due to not being able to pay credit card payment. For example, I work outside I live in South Florida, and was affected by hurricane Ian due to the amount of rain that it left behind. I asked for a late fee waiver due to me, not being able to work because of all the rain and it was denied due to company policy , not due to being a committed customer. Very bad company. I understand that most people will write good reviews, but it’s only because they were not faced with certain situations as others, like myself. I asked to speak with a supervisor in which they can only repeat what the associate would say naturally. The supervisors are no help.

NOW NEXT PYMT DUE AND IF I DON\\'T PAY THE LATE FEE ANOTHER LATE FEE WILL BE APPLIED! ORIGINAL CALL WAS REFUSED BEING ABLE TO SPEAK TO SUPERVISOR. ASKED FOR SUPERVISOR CALL BACK, ALSO NEVER HAPPENED. WAANT MY DUE DATE CHANGED 2 DAYS SO ALL MY BILLS COULD BE PAID ONCE THRU A BILL PYMT SERVICE AND WAS ALSO REFUSED. EVERYONE ELSO WAS HAPPY TO COMPLY. BAD COMPANY TO DEAL WITH!\\n\\nAvant\\nGot an email that said they increased…\\nGot an email that said they increased my credit limit from $500 to $750. I log in and it says my credit limit is $300. Have been calling for 3 days to figure out what happened and they keep saying the system is down.\\n\\nAvant\\nWrongfully holds funds when payment is made on time.\\nBlocked me from using my funds on 9/26 because of a payment due on 9/25.... Get this, which I paid on the 25th on time. First, I\\'ve never had a company block funds because of a late payment by a day, but the facts are that payment was made on time and not late. They can see it in their system as pending and won\\'t unblock until it posts, which we all know takes a couple of business days. So the majority of their customers would have to be having their funds blocked for payments they make on time, on their due date, while their payments are in pending. I even explained I\\'m visiting my dying dad in ICU and needed a hotel and they refused to do anything even though they can see my payment was made on time. Then, I was told that my payment would go through at the end of the day 9/26 and unblocked for 9/27. I called back 9/27 and it\\'s still blocked, with the agent telling me it\\'s still in pending even though I can see payment posted with a thank you note. I will never ever use this company again and am paying it off and recommend no one else use them. This policy of theirs was not in the terms and conditions when applying for credit.\\n\\nEdit to reply to Avant\\'s reply: Why would I waste more time calling you when I\\'ve called three times and even spoke to a supervisor? My dad is dying, I don\\'t need to waste my time with a company like you who didn\\'t try to make it right several times.\\n\\nAvant\\nAvant is shutting down all accounts on 11/30/22\\nEdit 9/30/22 - Avant announced via email that all Avant deposit accounts would be closed by 11/30/22 due to their partnership with Evolve B&T ending. Avant launched their deposit account product in December of 2021, so this product will have existed for less than a year by the time it shuts down. So much for helping underserved people huh? Shutting their bank account down after 9 months.\\n\\nI will leave the rest of my original review untouched, but this review was written before the shutdown notice was released to any individual customer.\\n\\nAvant sucks. Never forget that.\\n\\n\\n\\nI would never ever recommend Avant bank to anyone. Not in a million years.\\n\\nFirst off, they trick you into opening an account. Like many of you, I was looking for a credit card for those with low credit scores looking to rebuild their credit. I came across the Avant card and applied for it. After applying, I wasn’t actually told if I was approved or not, I was just told “thanks for applying. We have something else that might help you.” I actually didn’t realize this was for a checking account, but wanting the credit card I continued. Then I see I was denied the credit card. So what the heck did I just open? A checking account. Cool, so now I’m stuck with this checking account I don’t really want, but if there’s a chance they can help me achieve a healthier financial life, I thought why not. Moved all my money over, all my bill payments, all my direct deposit, and closed my old checking account. Avant was my future for banking, I guess.\\n\\nThat was just over 2 months ago. Now, about 9 total weeks after opening the account, I’ve closed my Avant checking account and want to warn everyone who might read this to stay the heck away from them.\\n\\nContinuing with their flaws, this is an anemic checking account. I haven’t been able to confirm whether or not they actually use Chexsystems, but I would assume they don’t; in that case, there’s literally no reason to open this account unless for some reason you’re not able to open one with Chime or SoFi, two other non-Chexsystems fintech companies that offer completely free feature-rich checking AND savings accounts. Avant deposit accounts are checking-only (no savings account offering whatsoever) with no APY, no Zelle, no checks, no check deposit (mobile or physical), no cash deposit, no physical locations, no peer-2-peer payment system whatsoever, no dedicated bill pay, a really bad ATM system (not even AllPoint offering), and most importantly, really bad account limits. They also code transactions like Cash App and Apple Cash as “ATM withdrawals,” which means that you can kiss goodbye any chance of using your Avant account to pay rent (since there are no checks either), as their ATM limits are hard-capped at $310 unless you’ve been their customer for over a year.\\n\\nNext, let’s talk about their support. It basically doesn’t exist. They’re a bank that uses a ticket-based customer support system, which should already be a red flag for most people. If it isn’t, I should tell you now that despite this ticket-based support system, customer support will still go out of their way to waste your time. I was trying to close my account and was asked to give a reason why, as well as to confirm with the last 4 of my SSN and my DOB. I gave them the last 4 and my DOB, and they came back hours later with a copy-paste of the same message asking for a reason why I’m closing my account. Yes, they make you wait hours for a response but will still pester you for your opinion. Instead of just being a decent customer service representative and processing my request, they had to waste my time one last time before I ceased being their customer. Fantastic job. The most ironic thing was them telling me “here are some reasons you might wanna rethink your decision.” If there was any chance of me rethinking my decision, it was erased the moment you proved that you have NO respect whatsoever for my time. Aside from that, they have a phone number that you can call that isn’t 24/7 (no 24 hour line whatsoever), and that’s it. And just as the icing on the cake, Google is pretty much useless if you have this account; all Google results are tailored to their credit card, so whenever you search “Avant” or “Avant checking” with your problem, the ONLY results you’ll receive will either be insanely basic or won’t be relevant because they’ll be tailored towards another product. So in my mind, this bank account has no value if you value customer support at all.\\n\\nAll in all, Avant’s checking/deposit account is just kinda pointless. An anemic account with no features, you’d be far better off with a local credit union or something like SoFi or Chime. With no customer support to back it up, this account is completely pointless and I recommend you look elsewhere if you care about your money.\\n\\nThanks for reading!\\n\\nAvant\\nLoan Experience\\nApplying for $1000 loan was customer friendly, and in terms of functionality.\\n\\nAvant\\nAvant will offer you a credit line…\\nAvant will offer you a credit line after a hard inquiry & then take the offer off the table saying you don\\'t qualify. The company is extremely unprofessional in doing an inquiry approving you then taking it off the table. Now who does that??????? that is truly legit sure not Capital one or Navy Federal.\\n\\nAvant\\nGood card credit to have\\nDate of experience: September 21, 2022\\n\\nAvant\\nCustomer happy 😊\\nThank you so much appreciate\\n\\nAvant\\nNot happy at all with the customer…\\nNot happy at all with the customer service!!!!!\\n\\nAvant\\nIncrease\\nAvant was very helpful in my request for an increase to my credit card.

I thought they were the best sweetest company just like you and for credit bump and another credit increase. But, when I got sick from my job and almost lost every including my car I asked them to initially work with me and they refused. To please give me time until I try to fight for my disability money that I was fighting for. I asked please stop making it harder for me since I have always made all my payments with a zero balance. They refused. Do not be fooled by this card company because now I am still sick and every month they are sending me a bill the says now late payment 795.00 due and it keeps going up my credit limit was only 1200.00 please stay far away from this company because I gave them at one time an excellent rating until I saw the true side of avant- don’t say I didn’t warn you\\n\\nAvant\\nGreat experience so far and thank you…\\nGreat experience so far and thank you for the credit increase,loved.\\n\\nAvant\\nI love my Avant card\\nI love my Avant card!

VERY HAPPY\\nApplied for Avant card thru Credit Karma or Experian (can\\'t recall which though...). Approval was fast and easy! Got card within 2 weeks. Used the card judiciously and always paid before or on time. Started off w $300 line. Several months later line was increased to $500 then maybe 1-2 months later they doubled my line to $1000. They\\'ve been very generous with increases with responsible use. The Avant mobile app is great for managing account, making payments, etc. I also use their online portal for acct management. Great company! I\\'m very happy with my Avant card.\\n\\nAvant\\nAnnual fee, for what?\\nPayment takes too long to arrive and post if paid through my bank like I do for every other credit which post in 2-3 days max. I have to call in my payment now.

It was so quick I was nervous that I was being hacked! I ended up calling a rep because my log on locked and wouldn\\'t allow me entry. I\\'m \"guessing\" that was a security method to change my password. At any rate, rep was very nice, like where are these people??? This is no longer the norm with customer service. I could have requested a higher loan but only needed to pay a quick bill to build my score even higher. I was approved in minutes.\\n\\nAvant\\nThey increase my credit line when I…\\nThey increase my credit line when I needed it the most!

I was prequalified with Avant and the initial process was great. My credit score was 630 on 8/31 as I received the letter from Regions showing my credit score on Expiearn and also Transunion.\\n\\nHere is the part that would make anyone scream... This all took place over a week. Numerous times having to submit documents.\\n\\nAfter I submitted the application- I had to sync my bank accounts-Provide paystubs-Provide copies of my IRA statement-Provide my spouse\\'s paystubs. Everything I sent lined up with my application. They requested these documents over the course of a week. When you call you will get zero help- I mean ZERO help.\\n\\nI tried emailing and my email was not responded to for three days. When it was to was of Zeto help.\\n\\nWhen you go to their dashboard to check the status or see what\\'s going on.. all it says is you have things to do and your application is going to expire. But when you call them about it- they say there is nothing you need to do and nothing to turn in continue checking your dashboard, but you do and it says it is about to expire, and yet you need to do nothing. If it expires they have you reapply which is another hard inquiry on your credit report.\\n\\nI have never written a review before but was so mad about this process I had to share my experience.\\n\\nI\\'m sure this company and loan program are and have been wonderful options for many. For me, it was such a runaround and horrible experience.\\n\\nAvant\\nVery good card and i have had excellent…\\nVery good card and i have had excellent experience with customer service.\\n\\nAvant\\nIf I could give 0 stars I would\\nIf I could give 0 stars I would. I paid $365 on a personal loan today and only $130 went towards paying it off everything else was interest and a bunch of stuff that was in the small print I just did not understand. Please be extremely careful Avant does not want to help you they want to rape you take full of vantage of you while you’re in a vulnerable position just trying to get ahead in life. This is exactly how the rich stay rich and the poor stay poor, fool me once shame on you,this will never happen again to me. I had a really hard life, and now within the past five years I’ve been able to get my life on track build credit and do some things now I’m at a point where I want to move forward and I just wanted to consolidate some things and move forward efficiently instead I completely screwed myself dealing with Avant. Now I have to wait to buy house for me and my family and do other things in life because of Avant. If you deal with this company you are not moving forward,you are moving backwards while they are moving forward with your money please don’t do it just work hard and pay your stuff off like I should’ve did. I work very hard for my money I guess I should’ve just been a little more patient in paying stuff off, because in the end that’s the way the situation would’ve paid off the best. Avant are organized thugs that are legitimately robbing people that don’t have nothing to begin with.\\n\\nAvant\\nThe loan application was quick and…\\nThe loan application was quick and easy.

I was able to payoff my credit cards and consolidate to one payment a month\\n\\nAvant\\nGreat credit card to have!\\nI think Avant is a great credit card to have. I really like the fact that you can make the payments with your debit card from your bank account which automatically debits the payment from your bank account instead of waiting the 3 days for the bank payment to clear. The Interest rate is low and after making consistent payments you are able to receive a credit increase. The website is also very easy to navigate through. I highly recommend this card.\\n\\nAvant\\nHelped with money needed to consolidate…\\nHelped with money needed to consolidate credit cards. Received reasonable rate and payment terms.

I just decided to close my account, which now I have to call another number!!! NO THANKS!\\n\\nAvant\\nRIDICULOUS HOOPS to jump through\\nRIDICULOUS HOOPS to jump through\\n\\nA scammer opened an account in my name through Avant, because they make the process super easy for scammers, and tried to get funds. Those funds were denied apparently. But these are the hoops Avant wants people to jump through for them to acknowledge scammers hurting YOUR CREDIT through THEIR COMPANY PRACTICES.\\n\\nDon\\'t do business with them. The reviews from customers make it clear Avant will WASTE HOURS of your time to clear up any issues you run into with them.\\n\\nEMAIL RECEIVED FROM AVANT:\\n\\nThank you for contacting Avant. Your account has been forwarded to us because you have indicated that you do not believe you applied for credit from Avant. Avant has been able to locate an account in your name. It is important to note that the application in question has not been funded. However, an inquiry may have been initiated by Avant into your credit profile. Inquiries can affect your credit score and are visible to third parties viewing your credit report. If you still believe you have not applied for credit from Avant, please take the following steps:\\n\\n1. Print and complete the attached “Identity Theft Victim’s Complaint and Affidavit” (“Affidavit”). The Affidavit must explicitly mention Avant in order to be accepted. You must have the Affidavit (item 22 on page H-6) witnessed by a Notary Public. If you elect not to complete the attached Affidavit, you must file a Law Enforcement Report, described in item 20 on page H-5 of the Affidavit, or an IC3 referral form. The law enforcement Report or IC3 referral form must explicitly reference Avant in order to be accepted. Filing a false Law Enforcement Report may result in criminal prosecution with penalties up to a felony conviction.\\n\\n2. Deliver the Affidavit, Law Enforcement Report or IC3 referral form and any other supporting evidence of identity theft you may have, to Avant via email, fax or mail.\\n\\nAvant\\nI thought this was a good idea...but…\\nI thought this was a good idea...but no. I applied for an received an Avant card. The very first time I used it, it was declined. When I called, the rep said their systems were down. So I asked where could I go to find out if they were having issues like that before I tried to use it. The answer: No where. Good luck.\\nThen, when I was able to use it, and went online to pay the bill, I called and asked when would my payment be posted to my account. They said within one day. BUT it would not be considered available credit for 10-15 days. So really you really only have access to the the available credit on the card about 15 days out of the month? Why is it Capital One and Chase can post a payment the day you pay them and Avant needs 15 days. Paid off the card and stuck it in a drawer. Useless.\\n\\nUPDATE: So I reached out to Avant like their response said and asked how they were going to \"fix the situation.\" And their response was no response. The reply said to email them. And then when I did, they said I had to call. Guess what will happen when I call? This company posts responses to these reviews as a way to seem like they are listening. They are not. Clearly. #reallybadmarketing\\n\\nAvant\\nThis company is operating illegally and…\\nThis company is operating illegally and should not be used by any service member! They have refused to comply with the Ohio SCRA benefits and state they are in compliance with all state and federal laws and are committing fraud! DO NOT USE THEM! They will try and charge you a high interest rate even with federal and state laws protections that are to be in place! Google Ohio SCRA and it clearly states that refusal to apply this benefit could result in jail time! The CEO needs to be held accountable for hiring people who fail to have a companies best interest and my contract needs to be voided! I have contacted the Ohio attorney general, filed a complaint with the BBB, and will notify the military branches of their unethical practices.\\n\\nAvant\\nThey are great at Avant!\\nThey are great at Avant!!

There was nothing fast about it at all. This would have been my 3rd loan through Avant. It would appear they only finance high interest loans and once your credit score goes up they are no longer interested in financing you since you qualify for a lower rate. It\\'s a disgrace. I full intend to reach out to their corporate offices due to this terrible experience. I spent over 3 hours in the last 3 days trying to get an answer and all I got was the runaround. I don\\'t know what changes have been made to their personnel over the last 2 years, but it is terrible.

I supplied bank statements which show deposits. Not enough for Avant.

My card was used for fraud and they still forced me to pay for it. Once I have paid this card off I am canceling it. Please stay away from them!\\n\\nAvant\\nFRAUD\\nThis stupid company sent me emails to ask how they are doing. I DO NOT USE AVANT. My Tech Company, Tech To Us which costs me a fortune but is worth it, uses malwarebytes. We emailed them back and said if I see one charge in my banks or credits cards they will be reversed immediately.\\n\\nAvant\\nCredit card review\\nI like this card it\\'s pretty much for ppl starting to build credit, it\\'s helped me so far i wish they would give an increases in my limit and drop the interest rate from being so high.\\n\\nAvant\\nScam Alert from “support&e.avant.com”\\nLooks like a simple Phishing Email Scam. The Actual company knows about it and has even posted a blog post about people posing as them.\\n\\nJust google Avant “Protect Yourself from These COVID-19 Scams” and their company blog post explains what happened.\\n\\nI would honestly just say throw the email out it’s just a scam like normal these days.\\n\\nAvant\\nEasy to get my credit card.

I thought my identity had been stolen. I have NEVER used or applied for a personal loan through them. I lost sleep that night because their call center was closed for the evening and I had no way of contacting them. After calling them the next day they told me that I DO NOT HAVE AN ACCOUNT with them and they could not even tell me exactly where they got my full name and email address from. This Makes me wonder if they are opening customer loan accounts just like Wells Fargo and US Bank were doing until they got caught by the FEDS. If you notice over 90% of the positive reviews are from people they invited to leave a review. Then they messed up and sent invites to people that they should not have and boom! This just shows how messed up this company is they send invites to people that will give them positive reviews. I tried clicking on the link they sent me but it was disabled even after I called them and they assured me that the link still worked even though I was going to rate them horribly. I have a feeling this is the same for everyone else that got these fraudulent review invites. DO NOT DO BUSINESS with a company that is willing to make up reviews! They do it because they are crooked.\\n\\nAvant\\nGreat service\\nDate of experience: August 21, 2022\\n\\nAvant\\nSolicited review…\\nHad a personalized email sent to me soliciting this review. I have never done business with this company and was very suspicious. Due to these practices I would caution folks away from Avant.\\n\\nAvant\\nScam\\nI’m glad that I came to this site and read the reviews on Avant. I received an email from them requesting I review them on Trust Pilot. I’ve never dealt with them and was concerned someone had used my credit. After verifying all is well, I became angry. How Dare They, SCAM!\\n\\nAvant\\nI was having some security problems…\\nI was having some security problems which have been fixed. My account was locked.

Thing is I never have done business with then or even heard of them. Hope this isn’t a scam or someone has gotten my identity and opened an account with them? So who do these folks get my email address from? One of my hacked email accounts.\\n\\nAvant\\nScam alert.\\nJust like many others i have read here. I received an email from them, asking me to review them here. I am not a customer of theirs. I never will be after dealing with the stress of this, i am vigilant when it comes to my credit, and who i do business with. Hopefully i didnt screw up be replying to the email support team letting them know i dont have an account with them.\\n\\nAvant\\nDon\\'t do it\\nI attempted to get a credit card (trying to fix past issues). They not only denied me in like 2 mins, but then repeatedly spammed my email. Smh, don\\'t believe the talk of credit for anyone.\\n\\nAvant\\nI received an unsolicited email from…\\nI received an unsolicited email from them requesting I review them. I have never done business with this company. After reading the reviews on this site I now know this is a scam to get individuals to believe someone opened an account under their name and then contact Avant and provide personal information to them. STAY AWAY!!\\n\\nAvant\\nDon\\'t Use This Site\\nTried to set up a fund through Avant that would be a retirement plan later on. Since I needed to change my address, I requested the change. Through some form of miscommunication, my account got cancelled, and I couldn\\'t access it, but was still getting billed. While I never got refunded, and they did finally stop charging me, it was a big waste of time and effort.\\n\\nAvant\\nWow absurd and solicitous. Avant- wants to know how they are doing via email even if you aren’t a customer.\\nI get an email asking how avant- is doing and wanting me to leave a review when I don’t even have an account with them. This is solicitation. Their records are so inaccurate they don’t even sort through who is a current customer and who is not. Definitely a no go!!!\\n\\nAvant\\nNo idea why this company keeps emailing…\\nNo idea why this company keeps emailing me to write reviews when I have no clue what it is.\\n\\nAvant\\nFishing scam emails.\\nThese people sent me an email about a random account i never created telling me to come here. They also wanted personal info just to check my account to see if a scammer has been using them to rob from me. Its clear this company is trying to fish for my info. Stay away from these people. Im not the only one, if you apparantly call them they still fish for info all while threatening you with possible fraud goijg on your account\\n\\nAvant\\nExcellent Customer Service\\nExcellent Customer Service, Easy to Navigate Mobile App..\\nGreat Company to do business with!\\n\\nAvant\\nQuestionable Data Security\\nUPDATE: to my surprise, I just checked my account and saw that all fraudulent charges were refunded plus the interest charges for each. I have increased my rating to 3 stars as I didn’t have to call again or hound them to credit my account. Still some red flags though about their data security though that I can’t ignore, and the fraud department process was very odd. I also just received an email yesterday that I was declined for a credit card however I did not apply for a second one so I’m not sure what that’s about….\\n\\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\\nI have to assume that 90% of their 5 star reviews must be fake because Avant either has some serious security/data issues OR they are the issue. I’m leaning towards the latter. Since I was first approved for my Avant card I’ve been having some serious issues with mass spam emails and fraudulent activity.\\n\\nI had 7 fraudulent charges on my Avant card last month and my attempts to rectify the issue has shown Avants true colors and I completely question their legitimacy. I don’t believe they have any actual employees and I really question whether companies like this are really the problem, rather than the “ghost hackers” out there stealing data. If I could go back in time, I absolutely would not have disclosed any of my information to this company. Period.\\n\\nAvant\\nHighly recommended\\nHighly recommended! I have used Avant multiple time to deal with unexpected expenses and it has always been a good experience.\\n\\nAvant\\ngot an email asking me to write a…\\ngot an email asking me to write a review, i either have not applied with this company or was denied, either way why would they want me to write a review?\\n\\nAvant\\nEasy application for the loan process\\nEasy application for the loan process, I was approved right away and got my money within 5 days. When I called customer service they answered all my questions. I\\'d definitely use avant again\\n\\nAvant\\nCustomer service needs training.\\nI have meant to cancel this credit card for 5+ years now and just hadn’t. When the widespread compromise occurred, I received no notification, no information for weeks after I realized it happened. When I initially called they were reassuring, it would be fixed in a timely matter and not reported to the credit bureaus. That was a lie. Do I care that a measly $500 was reported? Not particularly. I do care, however, that they were misleading, or at the very best misinformed and obviously unable to handle such a compromise. To add to that, the second time I called customer service to inquire as to why it had not been resolved in all this time and had been reported despite their convincing reassurance it would not be, the customer service representative used phrases like “as I was saying before you interrupted me” and ultimately hung up on me. Your job is customer service, customer service in a financial institution at that, expect people to be upset when their money is compromised and learn to fix the issue rather than escalating it. I can’t comment on anything other than that. However, fraudulent charges occurring in the first place, the time is took to resolve, and the absolute lack of professionalism from customer service makes this company an absolute no go from me.\\n\\nAvant\\nThis company gave me a credit card when…\\nThis company gave me a credit card when I was trying to rebuild my credit after an unfortunate series of events. Their card was a lifesaver, allowing me to make ends meet until I dug myself out of the hole. Now, I am so thankful that they came through for me when nobody else seemed willing to trust me. I give them an A+!\\n\\nAvant\\nPredatory lending company with another billion dollar owner.\\nHello,\\n\\nSuck my balls.\\n\\nRespectfully,\\nScott K\\n\\nEdit to the response: Respectfully, suck my balls. Thanks!\\n\\nAvant\\nThey just mailed me asking to review\\nThey just mailed me asking for a review, but I never been on their website. It is very concercing that they steal your personal information.\\n\\nAvant\\nGreat card!\\nGreat card, accepted wherever I go so far and easy to track activity online. I have a high interest rate but I also have a fair credit score so it\\'s what\\'s expected. Easy to apply and they gave an automatic increase after a couple months. Just pay your bill on time.\\n\\nAvant\\nThey let applications expire and you have to resubmit over and over again\\nWe were referred to this company to apply for a personal loan through Experian boost unfortunately for us it was the wrong decision they let our application expire on two different locations and on the last occasion we got an email from the third-party creditor where they had submitted our application saying that they had made a counter offer, but we never received it. I would not recommend doing business with this company They don’t do direct lending they send it to other companies to apply for the loan in our experience it was not worth it. very stressful resubmitted document over and over and very little communication between the customers and customer service instead of updating us with what was really happening they were letting our application expire and not getting back to us . Terrible experience\\n\\nAvant\\nAvant may be scamming people into becoming unwitting customers\\nAvant has seemingly resorted to spam email campaigns to trick people, whose information they’ve bought from a data broker, into giving them sensitive personally identifiable information so they can claimed these people as customers. This is evident from the fact they show you an avatar, tied to your email address by data brokers, when you enter it. Then, should you reset your password, they ask for your SSN and date of birth, as the SSN allows them to claim you, and birth dates from data brokers may not be reliable.\\n\\nDo not give them this information! Set a unique/secure password, then exit out of the process. Pull a full credit report to ensure no one has signed up with an account under your name.\\n\\nI called their support. They told me how they take fraud seriously, and then they hung up on me!!\\n\\nIf any lawyers are looking to form a class-action suit based on this campaign, I’d love to join.\\n\\nAvant\\nA Bit \\'Scant\\' on \"AVANT\"!\\nI recv\\'d this email requesting that I write a review OF THIS \\'company\\' on TrustPilot. Usually, I\\'m very astute w/who I conduct business with. However, I haven\\'t ever had any correspondence w/this company, so any review relating to their \"\\'quality\\' of service\" would admittedly, lack credibility and be based on falsehood.\\n\\nI\\'ve done consumer advocacy work for over 20 years now, and have written many reviews on several sites. Typically, a legit company doesn\\'t solicit or request that customers review them. That\\'s almost wholly initiated voluntarily. But Avant admittedly caters to low credit score applicants in their issuing of Secured Credit Cards.\\n\\nHowever, given that my score is actually exceptional, I\\'d have absolutely NO USE for their services. My guess, quite frankly, is that they\\'re soliciting Shadow Reviews from unsuspecting applicants in order to bolster their image. Well they\\'ve met their match here!!!\\n\\nSuffice it to say though, not having EVER done business with them B4, doesn\\'t otherwise prevent me from suggesting or stating that I feel that this \\'company\\' is employing a questionable business tactic in their quest to bolster their image for added recognition.\\n\\nIf, however, they reach out to me and can substantiate my actually contacting them, then clearly I\\'d reconsider this posting, based on what I then learn, and modify this review! My guess though...that\\'ll never happen.\\n\\nUntil then, \"Avant\" seems a bit SCANT to me!!!\\n\\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\\nMy response to their \"Blow-off\":\\nBelow this supplement, you\\'ll see what, in effect, is a tacit denial and an outright failure to take responsibility for their predatory marketing practices rather to instead, do what\\'s right and own up to their engagement in these bogus marketing practices that prey on less aware individuals! Maybe the FTC would be interested in their game-plan?!\\n\\nAvant\\nI’ve never used them but they keep…\\nI’ve never used them but they keep sending me unsolicited emails asking for a review so I can only assume they are annoying and bad to work with.\\n\\nAvant\\nThe card has very high interest rates\\nThe card has very high interest rates. You won\\'t get a credit line increase. I barely use this card.\\n\\nAvant\\nWhat was the point of this?\\nGot a random email to rate them today despite never signing up. Reset the password to get into the account, and had to complete the sign up, so it\\'s not something I registered and forgot about. Applied and was declined, not surprising, but why create an account for me and send me an email to rate you if you didn\\'t even bother to do a cursory prescreening check that would have told you I was ineligible? Oh, and the rate link they sent was broken. I\\'m bored and petty and mildly annoyed now, so here sits this review.\\n\\nAvant\\nScammy company\\nSent me an email asking to review them. I never signed up for an account yet for some reason I have one. Highly suspicious activity by this company.\\n\\nAvant\\nYou are the best I ever seen !\\nDate of experience: August 20, 2022\\n\\nAvant\\nI recently opened an account with Avant…\\nI recently opened an account with Avant and I was given a great opening line of credit. The app is very user friendly, so far so good! 👍 Thanks Avant team!!\\n\\nAvant\\nThere nothing but a bunch of BullCrap\\nREFERENCE #279999\\nSo to start, I have to say that for me having a poor credit rating, they gave me that chance to build myself back up again and even trusted me for a $1500 credit limit to start. Now who ever developed the App is really bad at their job and needs to step down. 1st- it doesn\\'t track your spending with exact change, it rounds it self up to the next dollar so when you get close to your limit, you end up hitting it $15 early. So a few weeks ago I went out of town and ended up using $980. So that should leave me with $520. I\\'m at home and trying to buy an item online from a timed auction and win. I put in my card numbers to pay and it kept saying declined. It cant be cause of no credit so I don\\'t understand what\\'s going on. I call them up to be told that they\\'re having technical problems and all accounts were frozen. Needless to say, I lost the item and couldn\\'t even use my remaining credit for a full 2 months. I was told as soon as it\\'s fixed that I would receive a email but that never happened. I just randomly discovered it on my own, just past the 2 month mark. What\\'s funny is that they could still do statements, collect your payments for sure and create new Ads to get you to make extra payments to get ahead.\\nSo this month (August) I made an attempt to make 2 early payments and then my monthly payment. The app gave me alot of trouble taking my new card# from my Square account but finally got it, or maybe not. My 2 $50 payments and my $100 one got canceled. Now once I realized it, it\\'s past the due date and I get hit with a $25 late fee. I didn\\'t receive a single email for any of the payment problems, no text, or nothing in my app portal. This is horrible and a super sloppy way to run a financial institution. Stay away and Don\\'t Say That I Didn\\'t Warn You!!!!!\\n\\nAvant\\nJust in case this is read\\nJust in case this is read. !!Be AWARE!! I got this card knowing there would be a fee. But NOT knowing the Annual Fee would show up 2wks after receiving card. I haven\\'t even received a bill yet. Sent my card into overdrawn status & credit report blemished that quick. 😡\\n\\nAvant\\nAvant- is awesome they know when you…\\nAvant- is awesome they know when you need an increase and they always make sure your doing fine with your use of your card.\\n\\nAvant\\nDon\\'t ask for loan unless you don\\'t need one.\\nOkay, never used avant. But this morning received an e-mail asking for a trustpilot review. I went to the avant website and went ahead and applied for a loan. I asked for the lowest amount possible. I knew that my credit was not good, but hoped it might qualify. Nope, sure didn\\'t. But since this seemed to be the first time checking with them, why did they ask for a review. Well, here it is. Don\\'t bother, it\\'s just another thing on your credit report. May not matter much, may affect it a few points. I\\'ll find out in a couple of days.\\n\\nAvant\\nI never applied for a loan from them\\nI never applied for a loan from them. So to just receive an email one day is was concerning. Upon trying to call them I was on hold for over 30 min and no one ever answered. Then the link to review them in the email was broken. Very shady. Also I would never get a loan from a place that has suck crappy customer service that they won’t even answer the phone. Clearly they are scamming people.\\n\\nAvant\\nSPAM Alert : Getting spam stating I am using their…\\nGetting spam stating I am using their company services. I am not and all links on their email redirect to same dead link statement.\\n\\nAvant\\nUnsolicited email\\nGiving them a 1-star because they emailed me asking for a review, and I have no idea who they are. Unsolicited emails asking for a review raise some red flags\\n\\nAvant\\nHIGH FEES\\nHIGH FEES! Annual fee is ($59) and seems to be billed whenever they feel like it, late fee is $39, APR is around 28% which I think is actually illegal in some states. The website login working is 50/50. No credit limit increases in well over two years (my score is now significantly higher). It will help raise your score but a secured card with decent rates and customer service would be a better option. Also you can’t transfer your balance away and close the card. I had a promo of zero percent interest if I transferred my balances over to Barclay, avant refuses to transfer it.\\n\\nAvant\\nThis has been the best credit card…\\nThis has been the best credit card experience…easy application and app very easy to use! I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a good cc company.\\n\\nAvant\\nCustomer service horrible\\nCustomer service horrible. Their online verification horrible. Management horrible. Do not apply here by any means\\n\\nAvant\\nSpammers\\nSpammers, ask for reviews even if you decided not to do business with them. (They\\'re obviously buying reviews, this company would never be rated this high if they weren\\'t.)\\n\\nAvant\\nI have never heard of this company\\nI have never heard of this company until I received an email from them saying \"Thank you for choosing Avant\" and asking me to review them on Trustpilot, so here I am. I feel very uncomfortable with the fact that I am receiving these kinds of emails from a financial company I have never heard of.\\n\\nAvant\\nThey helped me when nobody else would\\nIt was my second credit card and they approved me for $1,000 limit when no one else would with zero annual fee the app has worked great and customer service has been great. Im Very thankful to have this card and also for the bump in my credit limit for being on time!\\n\\nAvant\\nIssue with use\\nCustomer service is always nice and have had no problems with my bill My issue is that I can hardly ever use this card every time I go to use it declines. I have no clue why considering it’s got the full credit amount on it. So then when I call customer service it’s always a oh we were having an issue or we thought it was a fraud charge. So I rarely even use this card because it’s always some kind of production. So I wish they would get there system working properly and know off this nonsense! I would not recommend this card to anyone for the pure fact that you will probably hardly ever use it. If they could fix this issue it would be fine.\\n\\nAvant\\nID Theft\\nReceived an email asking to post a review based on my experience with this company. I have never used them. This is an ID Theft issue and they don’t seem to care\\n\\nEdit:\\nReply to the reply\\n\\nHow can you say that when it’s only my first name listed here? Seems like a UDAAP violation\\n\\nAvant\\nHated it\\nHated it! It blocked almost ever site I visit on a regular basis. Sites I KNOW are safe so after three days I uninstalled it and unsubscribed. It may work for other people but is sure did not for me....\\n\\nAvant\\nThank you for approving my loan as fast…\\nThank you for approving my loan as fast as you did. This is my second loan from Avant and I am very happy with the process. Leonard C. Faris\\n\\nAvant\\nI love Avant\\nI love Avant! Some credit cards make you wait between 2 business days or 2 weeks to restore your credit available, but with Avant it is immediate. I think this is so because Avant is classified as a \"non-bank financial service\" It also is much easier to contact Avant online or by phone.\\n\\nAvant\\nThe most frustrating customer service…\\nI sent a check to have the card paid off. I called customer service on three occasions. I was checking to see if it had been received or get a timeline through which I should wait or cancel the check as lost in the mail. The representative each time was very difficult to understand, but I was given a different timeline each time I called. The check recently showed up on my dashboard as having been received four days prior . . . and four days after I was told that I should just cancel the check because there was no record of it. I paid off a few different cards around the same time, and this was, without a doubt, the most frustrating customer service experience.\\n\\nAvant\\nWhy 4 Stars?\\nI didn\\'t give 5 stars because you only have 2 auto payment options. They are All or Minimum Due. A third option being a set amount higher than the minimum would have gotten the 5th star.\\n\\nAvant\\nI been with Avant for 1 year and 3…\\nI been with Avant for 1 year and 3 months and as soon as I got my credit card I was told by a rep from Avant that I had 12 months to pay the annual fee. well I was charged the annual fee on the first month. I called up Avant and they gave me some b.s excuse. I gave a review on here and they said for me to call them so they can fix it well I called up C.S. and they gave me the same b.s. 3 times. C.S is horrible. I pay my bill on time, at least 12 days before the due date and I pay an extra $15.00 on top of my monthly fee. they denied me for an increase which is probably good because I just can\\'t anymore with Avant. So Avant when you read my review please don\\'t say\" We are sorry to hear that, please contact us so we can try to help you\" because I won\\'t call anymore.\\n\\nAvant\\nI love it very much!!\\nDate of experience: August 20, 2022\\n\\nAvant\\nDON\\'T DO IT. TRUST ME\\nI got a loan from avant 12/2020. I\\'ve made my payments on time every month. I\\'ve made double payments. I\\'ve made payments for hundreds more dollars than my actual payment is. One minute I login to view my loan/payoff loan balance, and the remaining balance was 1300 left to pay and now when I login it mysteriously has gone up to 2200. How from 12/2020 to 8/22 a 3800 loan, I have a balance of 2200??? It makes no sense. The approval process for a loan is pretty easy and simple. Once approved getting the funds, *oh and it wasn\\'t the full 3800 because they deducted a few hundred for the application and administrative fee is what I was informed by customer service* were fairly easy and simple. Paying the loan back has been a true nightmare and I will never go through this company again for a quick loan.\\n\\nAvant\\nAbsolutely horrendous customer service…\\nAbsolutely horrendous customer service experience. Random calls asking for personal info without having proof they\\'re avant, no way to dispute fradulent transactions, and pure confusion with no accountability. 2 stars since the design of the website is sharp.

My card sat inside a lockbox since the day I got it. It was not used anywhere not one time! Got an email about suspicious activity a week after the \"suspicious\" charges. My card got maxed out with 3 fraudulent charges in a day & it was not caught by the company for a week! Which still doesn\\'t explain how the card was compromised in the first place. Obviously their data is not secure AT ALL! The rep on the phone just kept trying to send me a new card & I had to ask repeatedly for the account to be closed. All the while their fraud team was \"looking into the matter\". Careful who you trust your information with, because this company will not keep it safe or fix fraudulent charges in a timely manner!\\n\\nAvant\\nEasy\\nVery easy process.

I could not be more grateful in that moment.\\n\\nAvant\\nGot approved with poor credit\\nI had less than desirable credit. What they would consider \"poor credit.\" I got approved for a $300 credit line unsecured and an annual fee of $39 i believe. Made on time payments. At 6 months I requested a credit line increase online. No hard inquiry on my credit for an increase in credit line and was instantly approved for an increase to $500. So far, the card has helped my credit and I have not had any issues.\\n\\nAvant\\nJOB WELL DONE.\\nHI, MY NAME IS LEROY AND THIS IS MY THIRD LOAN WITH AVANT.

The process was ridiculous. They will NOT email you when you need to update anything, and they will not call. You will have to keep checking your application if it needs to be updated. I applied last Wednesday night, about 4pm. I called on Friday to check the status and they kept speaking quick and he said he needed to submit it for review and is there anything else he could help me with, he tried to get me to hang up, but I stayed on the line. 20 minutes later he comes back and asks why my paystub comes from a different company and not mine, I had to explain this to him. After that, another THREE days they sent me an email to call them, and they told me my paystub bank account did not match the bank account I gave them. It was completely false, I literally had to walk them through the difference between a routing number and an account number. This took AN HOUR. Also they don\\'t speak clear english. Finally resolving it they took another day to post I need to verify other income to get to the right Net income, which was not correct because my net income was already OVER what they pre-approved me with. I think it was just stalling at this point because I submitted my husbands checks asap and they let it sit again without updating it. Then today I get an email that my loan application EXPIRED, and I would have to reapply. I have NO interest in getting a loan through this company anymore. I think they just collect your information for fraud reasons and then go about their day. No sense of urgency with them. You will not get a loan approved before it expires. Every review I have read that seems real, they all have the SAME issues.\\n\\nUPDATE: I will not be giving them a second chance. I secured a different loan on better terms from Prosper in 24 hours.\\n\\nAvant\\nI got what I needed.\\nThis is my 1st personal loan. And to be honest I was nervous about the whole thing. I didn\\'t think that I was going to get approved but I did. Thank God now I got the money that I needed and was able to pay off debts and credit cards. It\\'s definitely giving me some peace of mind knowing that now I have everything under one bill instead of spread over five or six. And the monthly rate is pretty cheap too for what I got?\\n\\nAvant\\nWould do business with again\\nThey approved me for a loan within minutes. Got a not so great rate but got a loan regardless. Arranged to pay it off over 3 years so it won’t break the bank.\\n\\nAvant\\nProbably the least painful loan…\\nProbably the least painful loan application I have filled out.

I was impressed by the speed and efficiency of the first loan allthough the interest was quite high. However i had challenged credit too. The second i almost didnt do because it showed same interest as the first. But once i did apply the rate dropped consistent with my new credit rating. I would recomend them to strengthen challnged credit and pay off debt.\\n\\nAvant\\nAvant really help me get back on track…\\nAvant really help me get back on track financially. Thank you.\\n\\nAvant\\nThis is the best and easiest credit…\\nThis is the best and easiest credit card I have ever used. I recommended it to my family.\\n\\nAvant\\nNo major complaints\\nMy experiences with Avant have mostly been positive. It was a little unclear what was going on with my application for refinancing my loan, but it was ultimately approved. (It just took more than a week.) ONE thing I would really like to see is the breakdown of principal and interest for each payment. I don\\'t see anywhere to find this information.\\n\\nAvant\\nDon’t apply for this loan!!!!!\\nDon’t apply for this loan!!!!!\\nI applied for there loan and it’s been a week and I keep speaking to the same representative I think it’s a fraud. First off you never call and get the same representative on different days and different times well I have, which is suspicious right there to say the least then I asked about a supervisor and of course they weren’t available. No surprise there. Now with the world with inflation problems that just what we need more people scamming to get money we don’t have.\\n\\nAvant\\nI am a previous customer with Avant\\nI am a previous customer with Avant. They gave me a personal loan when I was really financially stressed. I was able to pay off the loan 2 years in advance. After several months, they started sending me emails to apply for another loan. I finally did on 7/20/22. Unlike the first experience, this one was a nightmare. They kept asking for the same documents over and over. Each time I submitted the documents, they would say I didn’t need to do anything else, but they would never say whether or not the loan was approved. Finally after 7 days, I received an email saying my application had expired and I could re-apply! So I did on 7/28/22. I got the same run around with the document requests but no follow-up from Avant. After a couple days, I just told them to cancel my application. I was frustrated. Not because I didn’t get the loan, but because they weren’t professional enough to let me know one way or another. I felt like just another piece of paper, rather than a person. If that’s the way they treat people, I’m glad I don’t have to do business with them. Oh, by the way, before I paid off the previous loan, I paid every payment on time.\\n\\nHelen R. Richmond\\n\\nAvant\\nVery well treated\\nVery well treated. Professional and polite. Made looking for a loan painless.\\n\\nAvant\\nI have not any problems with Avant and…\\nI have not any problems with Avant and customer service is excellent.\\n\\nAvant\\nRecent loan experience\\nI\\'m writing this review to help other customers to have a better experience than mine. I provided all required documents and they were not processed before the 7 day expiration. I had to send multiple emails with my verification info. I checked my dash board and there were things i submitted but had to resubmit. Unfortunately, my appication expired. I was instructed to resubmit my application. I complied because of the importance of this loan. Yes i was eventually approved but it was apparent that there wad a lack of communication between Avant representatives. I was getting frustrated having to explain and reexplain my situation. I also feel that consumers needing a loan should be reminded that they only have 7 days to submit. It can be added to the dashboard. I think this would be helpful.\\n\\nAvant\\nEasy to use & quick\\nDate of experience: August 03, 2022\\n\\nAvant\\nWasn\\'t sure they could help me,hada…\\nWasn\\'t sure they could help me,hada poor credit rating so may years,just tred my luck to apply online loan to my surprised it was approved within 5 minutes.will recommend them to whoever needs help try them.they really reliable\\n\\nAvant\\nI’m truly grateful for avant- and words…\\nI’m truly grateful for avant- and words can’t even explain but I am humbled that they gave me a personal loan when I really needed it and I will always be thankful for the great service they’re Providing to every customer.\\n\\nAvant\\nAs a returned customer\\nAs a returned customer, they offered, I excepted and it was put into my account as simply as that…1, 2, 3.

If someone stole someones identity, they have no way of finding the application.\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nPlease don’t contact me again\\nPlease don’t contact me again. You told me I was approved then you declined my application after you told me to enter the code from my email when I clicked over to get it declined my applications so after I carefully reviewed and thought about it I have made a decision if my own do not contact me by mail text or email. I’m good\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nMy experience was great because it…Second chances are REAL!\\nMy experience was great because it didn’t take long to complete the application and the approval didn’t take long.\\nThe company took a chance on me. Most companies only send denial letters.\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nRun fast and far away!!!!\\nIt\\'s super easy and quick to get the money. It\\'s also super easy to set up payment. My problem is the 134% interest. I understand you\\'re here to make money, but after paying on a $5000 loan for over a year now and still owe $4700 feels like straight up robbery. Long story short it\\'s super easy to sign yourself up to be taken advantage of. Thanks for the money, but please dissolve your company and yourselves.\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nFast and easy to use\\nWas need to get a loan to consolidate my credit cards to try to get my credit score up. This company was very easy to use and they were very fast about the process. They show you your payment schedule and are very upfront about their pricing. The loan is super expensive but I’m someone who needed it to help increase my credit score so it worked for me.\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nPayments\\nI don\\'t like the amount that I\\'m paying back getting taken out all at once instead of weekly or biweekly payments.\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nAll went fine\\nAll went fine, still waiting for a copy of my documents.\\nPlease mail me a copy asap\\nCan I please have phone number of customer service for any future response.\\nKind Regards,\\nSuzanne K wells\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nVery Pleased\\nRise made this experience VERY easy and was not made to feel like I should not have reached out to receive help.

Very good. Definitely recommend!\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nFriday before Christmas\\nI put in my application the Friday before Christmas. And I was hoping to get my loan on Saturday. But because it was on Friday the system was telling me I would probably going to get it on Tuesday the day after Christmas. When I opened up my bank account on my app on Saturday low and behold I had my loan on Saturday. My experience with rise credit was great was easy and I got my loan right away.\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nYou will be taken advantage of with a high APR.\\nI pulled out a loan for 3500 to take care of unforseen events in my life. They deposit the funds into your account within 24-48 hours however here\\'s the negative, they take advantage of the fact that you need money and take advantage by giving you a rate of 149%, that means if by the end of the loan term the total will be over 10,000$.\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nCustomer service and the fast response…\\nCustomer service and the fast response to help me with this loan was great.. and the peoples I spoke on the phone was professional and polite.. thank you\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nEasy to receive funds\\nDate of experience: March 15, 2024\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nThis is a predatory loan\\nThis is a predatory loan. It only gives you the option to pay more on the principal the same day payments are due, therefore if you think you want to pay it off early think again, you will be paying in full or paying twice as much over time on the loan. It does not allow you to remove autopay, it basically sets you up for failure. I have been paying on it for over 3 months now and still owe more than the amount I took out. I only got it to help with my credit and its not even reporting. I will be paying it and full and cashing it out on my next payday. Had I known what I knew now I would not have gotten it.\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nGod Bless America In Times of Help!\\nApplying for a loan with fin rise company was a good experience in that the team communicated effectively and efficiently in approving the loan and detailing how much the cost of the loan. The process was fast, easy and understandable even though this was an expensive loan. I was able to meet the help that I needed for the loan and very much appreciate the company was able to approve the loan. Thank you!\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nWowww\\nWowww! I don\\'t know how to thank Rise credit I was really in need I applied one day and the money was already in my account the next day I was so happy, I will recommend anyone to choose them they are so good. Please go and make the same experience I made you won\\'t regret it. God bless\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nFast services and approval...BUT!!!!!\\nFast services and approval...But however the pay back is out outrageous. Please make sure you apply on a desktop and not your cell phone were you can see every little detail. If I would have done it on the desktop I probably wouldn\\'t have gotten this loan. Just because of the pay back. So it\\'s based off how often you get paid not once a month like most loan companies I have dealt with in the past. Also the APR IS WAYYYYYY TO HIGH. If you\\'re not good at managing your money you could hurt your credit then try to build your credit.\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nTime Is Money, Money Is Time\\nIt didn\\'t take long to get a loan after all my information were taking. This is good because time is money and money is time. My loan was deposited in my bank account so fast, I couldn\\'t believe it. So I I\\'m satisfied with giving Rise a 5 stars rating.\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nApplied for it on a Friday\\nApplied for it on a Friday, still haven\\'t received it.

I paid my loan off early and they still took out a payment from my account. When I called on it, I was told it would be 3 to 5 days. They can give you money the same day but fixing the problem takes 3 to 5 days. They keep my money but when or if they return it without interest. 144% interest on my loan but no interest on keeping my money. ***UPDATE*** Today is 02/20/2024 and I\\'m still waiting for my refund. Was told this past Thursday that the refund would be there on friday. Guess what it\\'s Tuesday and was told again today 3 to 5 days but they are trying to expedite it.

Rise made it very difficult for me to update this information online so I resorted using my debit card to make payments online instead of checking account information. Long story short, they flagged my debit card as fraudulent and I was unable to make any more online payments. They will only receive cashiers checks as a single parent working full-time it’s hard to make it to the bank during banking hours to get these checks. Every time I get a different story one lady one as far as to letting me send her my new checking information via email and told me it would be updated so I could continue to make payments online. This never happened now now I can’t even access my online account to see how many payments I have left.

Funds where available the next day.\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nI don’t know what to believe anymore with Rise???\\nI am not really sure what to say or where to begin. I get this flyer in the mail with hopes to apply for this loan and get some added help. So me and my roommate elect to apply for a loan we both get approved for up to 5,000. So we choose what we want and it shows the amount we pay and the interest and the payments. So except the terms and sign the loan agreement and think we are getting funds in the next 24 hours like it says. Nope no funds I get an email later that day that we both need to send in information to verfiy my ID, SS card and recent bank statement. We both send the required info I call back they got both of our information and good to go. They said need to sign back in and except the terms and the loan again and sign we do that then told get the funds in another 24 hours. Okay at this point I am like okay wow this as gone on for 2 days now back and forth. I have been told I was approved and get my funds and haven’t. I check my email today and we both got an email saying we were denied. I am like what denied for what we were told we were approved it says this reason for denial “unable to verify application information based on documents provided”. So at that point I’m frustrated and upset feel lied to and betrayed I call back and ask for a better clarification they can’t give me one they said it’s automatic generated response I am like give me a number don’t have one. Wow and no one there a supervisor no one can assist. They tell me all you can do is wait the 10 days and apply again wow I’m thinking and this is a company. They should be taking to court on this and sued. They even hit me with a hard inquiry and it says will run credit for a hard inquiry once signed and approved well I was WTH!!!!!

Easy to use website, quick funding time, and loans to people who is in need of help like myself. Of course, rates are super high. The price you have to pay in a hard stuck financial situation.

Speedy response!\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nModern Legal Loansharks\\nThe only thing positive I can say is they got me a loan quickly with poor credit. Borrowed 5k in september of 2022 and paid loan off early, nov 2023 but still paid back almost 9k in interest, would have been 10k+ if i wouldnt have paid it off 7 months early. How can companies charge like loansharks in the movies. read that again, they made over 9k and was scheduled to make 10k on a 5k loan with payment terms less than 24 months. Again, like i said, atleast they got me the money when i needed it, but this helps explain why the rich get rich and the poor gets poorer.

But each time the representative replys back telling me at the this time I\\'m not a canadate to make any adjustments. She couldn\\'t explain any further details except to say oh when your qualified we will reach out to you to let you know. I told her don\\'t bother. Cause if I can get the help when I need it then I don\\'t need them to decide when it\\'s all good to go. It\\'s like after a perfect payment history it doesn\\'t make a difference.

My borrow amount was 3500. I’ve paid back 3800 in my balance currently is 3,399.00 and I still have over a year and a half to pay!!!\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nit was easy and fast\\nit was easy and fast , i had my money the next day .thanks rise\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nfast easy way to get money when you…\\nfast easy way to get money when you need it\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nGetting a loan is EASY!!\\nI NEVER thought getting a loan would be so EASY! I went to a typical financial institution to ask for a loan and there was so much red tape involved, you not only had to fill out a lot of paper work, you had to have collateral, and get insurance placed on yourself and the collateral and that added cost is also ADDED to your loan amount, which adds 1000\\'s of dollars to your loan, on top of that you STILL have to pay interest on the entire amount! For example, you may get a check for $6999, the insurance on you and your collateral may cost another $10,000 bringing your loan to around 17k, add interest and you are paying back 35k, when you only received a check for $6999. Do the math you pay back 5 times what you actually took home! With Rise the loan was fast and easy! The money was in the bank the next day and the payment plan is simple to follow. The loan can even be paid off early, saving you money! Thanks Rise, the next time I need money fast, I will come here first!!\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nStay away!!!\\nStay away!!!! Interest rates are way too high. I have used Rise for years and this year was the straw that broke the camel\\'s back. When applying for a loan, I always select the $2,250 loan with a payment schedule of 20 payments. This current loan I selected to do the same payment schedule. Fast forward a couple of months, I noticed my balance never went down only kept rising. Generally after a few payments, I would see a dollar or two come off of the balance, but this time I\\'ve only seen significant increases. I went to look at my contract and somehow my payback schedule was changed from 20 payments to 44 payments. I immediately called Rise Credit customer service to see if there was a glitch in the system because I would never select to make roughly the same payments I\\'ve made in a previous loan agreement for a longer term. So, now this new loan agreement is saying if I make all 44 payments will have paid back $8,430.79 for a $2250.00 loan. A total of $10680.78\\n\\nHere is the breakdown from the last three loans I have gotten through rise:\\n\\n1. (2023 44 weeks) $2250 270.85% $242.72 biweekly\\n\\n(8/30/2023 Edit: I received an email from Rise Credit corporate office stating that the rates and terms for a $2250 loan have changed from a maximum of 26 biweekly payments to a maximum of 44 biweekly payments. You no longer have the option to choose 20 or 26 payments. So, if you decide to go through with the loan for those 44 biweekly payments, you will have paid back $10,680.79 for a $2250 loan. The rates and terms on the \"What it costs\" tab are inaccurate.\\n\\n2. (2022 20 weeks) $2250 272.95% $262.20 biweekly\\n\\n3. (2021 20 weeks) $2250 277.97% $277.97 biweekly\\n\\nI am trying to figure out why in the world would I select to make more payments for roughly the same amount of money I was repaying in previous loans. I kept telling the representatives I spoke with that I would not select that. Also, if I selected to make 44 payments instead of 20 payments like I always do, wouldn\\'t my payments be less?\\n\\nSomething is not right and I know it. I have been trying to get the corporate office on the phone, but no one will return my calls. I need answers.\\n\\nWhatever you do, find another way because this company is scamming people.\\n\\nPlease, please, please pay close attention to every click you make. Screenshot every step, especially the rates and payback schedule you select. Go back and check to make sure your clicks were correctly recorded. Also, making extra payments towards your loan does not go towards your principal balance. You will be making extra payments for nothing. Either pay off as fast as you can or make regularly scheduled payments.\\n\\nMost importantly FIND ANOTHER SOURCE TO GET MONEY FROM.\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nThis loan was much needed especially…\\nThis loan was much needed especially being turned down by other lenders.\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nIt was easy to fill the application and…\\nIt was easy to fill the application and it didn\\'t take long for a answer of approval.\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nVery fast and convenient process\\nDate of experience: August 17, 2023\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nTHANK YOU FOR HELP🙏\\nTHANK YOU FOR HELP IAM VERY HAPPY👍👍👍\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nVery easy to use and fast decisions\\nDate of experience: August 18, 2023\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nGreat\\nYour help me out when I needed it so thank you so much\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nVery easy approval process fast funding…\\nVery easy approval process fast funding excellent customer service\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nThe ease of using the system\\nI was pleasantly surprised at the amount of time and ease it was to complete the process.

This also occurs when you finally are able to get a customer service rep on the phone as well.\\n\\nThis continues to happen over the same request for months now, which is ridiculous.

Borrower BEWARE! I’ve been trying to pay this loan off for over a month now. My bank sent them a check on 4/22 and it was never received. I spoke to Rise customer service and was told checks are credited to accounts same day received. So, My bank sent another overnight to them on 5/17 with tracking and signature required. It was received 5/18 and signed for by an employee. Several calls since then and given multiple varying answers. Once it wasn’t received. Next it was noted as received on my account and would post by 5pm that day (it did not), then they would contact me within 24 hours and it would be “escalated” — no call. I called them with my bank on three-way, and was informed it had not been received and they couldn’t verify if the person who signed had it or not…and that it would take 7-10 days from receipt to post…tons of excuses and lies! When the original check was mailed it would’ve paid this loan off. Now I have accrued over $400 in interest atop the original amount thanks to their daily interest charges. Wish I’d NEVER hit the accept button on this “loan” and I HIGHLY advise you to avoid them at all cost! I’ve paid my loan every month, on-time, and never an issue until I want to pay it off to better myself and get out from under some debt. This company is nothing more than a payday loan service at best. Complete and total loan sharks with horrible customer service and extremely questionable business practices.

For the most part, the experience has been great. The application process is easy, they work with you when you experience hardship, they take debit card payments which is oddly uncommon. I used to highly recommend them. Until today.\\n\\nI applied for a loan on Thursday 3/17. As a returning customer, the process was super easy. Just confirmed nothing had changed, hit submit, and was approved. I signed the loan agreement and they said the funds would be in my account the next day. The next day, the money isn\\'t in my account. I log on and it shows my loan is in the funding status. Ok, maybe they sent it that day and it would be in my account the next business day. Sunday I received an email reminding me that my first payment would be due on Friday 3/25. Today, not only was the money not in my account, but I received a request for more information. I sent the information right away, and almost immediately received an email saying my loan was declined. I\\'m researching whether this is illegal, but is unquestionably immoral and shameful from a customer service standpoint. I will never borrow from Rise again and can no longer recommend that anyone else do either.\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nVery easy\\nI have had a great experience with Rise credit.

The plan was to be able to repay the loan fast. However, my situation changed and my hope for a quick payoff disappeared. The payment from this company is far higher than any other similar loan companies I have used in the past. This is why I hoped to pay the loan off fast. Then when I hit a rough spot and fell behind in payments I attempted to work with RISE. They did offer a 3 payment plan to bring my account current. However, they locked my online account. So instead of allowing me the fastest possible way to make my payments, RISE made it incredibly difficult to make my payment plan payments. I tried to chat with customer service but they are useless. RISE even blocks their own customer service people from helping customers trying to make things right. All customer service does is give you a phone number to call. I found that to be a waste of time as well. Nor do I have time during the day to make phone calls and hang on the line forever! I was also told that after making 2 payments RISE would make 1 payment as part of the agreement to catch up my account. I was able to see my payment history, and to no surprise to me, one of my payments was missing in the payment history. What did RISE do with my payment? Did they hide my payment so they could claim I didn\\'t make it and not make the single payment promised to me? All I can say is if you are thinking about using this company for a loan, I would recommend trying some other company. I have found RISE uncooperative and unresponsive when trying to contact them. Also very unhelpful when you want to work with them. I have filed several complaints with the company with no meaningful response what so ever!! I hope this makes it to the top of the review list because you should be very cautious about using this company!\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nVery happy\\nVery happy with my Decision\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nFast turnaround\\nVery fast process, user friendly and great customer service.\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nVery quick and easy processing\\nVery quick and easy processing.

I applied to get a loan through Rise. I completed the online process and recieved a email notification that they needed to complete a bank verification. No problem right? Not with this company . I go to login in on their site ( I wrote down my credentials) and it would not work so I utilized the lost password feature . It did not send me a code nor a email link to reset . I tried both mobile and desk top . Used the auto chat feature and that was zero help . Emailed the helpdesk and they insisted i had forgotten my own bank login?? LOL If they would have read my email they would have comprehended that I was trying to access THEIR site . ZERO customer service , zero care .

But, after reading a few reviews and seeing how happy people were with their services I decided on giving them a try. The process went smoother than I expected. I did everything online. They reviewed everything within a day or so and before the weekend was over from when I applied on a Friday I had the funds in my account come Monday morning. I am very pleased with how fast the process went and how fast I got the funds.

Problem with my bank account number. According to the rep, the last number was missing, and somehow the funds were sent to another account. Not only did I not receive empathy or concern, but I was also told if the money is not returned I will be responsible for paying it back. I am still shocked the website does not have a pop where you enter an account number that warns applicants about the risk and consequences of a typo. Although I don\\'t think it was a typo because I entered it twice and double-checked. At the time my caution/concern about making a mistake was fear of an email saying \"Your account number is invalid or your account does not belong to Michael Sullivan,\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nGreat service\\nDate of experience: July 08, 2021\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nThank You all for assisting me\\nThank You all for assisting me, when I needed you most, in a timely matter.\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nEasy\\nEasy, quick and reliable.

What affected my credit rating was the plethora of hard inquiries accumulated while i was looking for a loan that i could afford (99% is high but it\\'s commensurate with risk and i understand that. High risk, high reward.) However, it pales in comparison to 150% to 450%. Yes, bunky, there are 450% loans out there.

I’ve disputed with proof (a letter addressed to ME at the person who stole my ID’s address) and they refuse to remove the fraudulent info from my credit reports. That little $1000 loan is going to end up costing them 10x that amount when I’m done. Terrible shady company!\\n\\nUpdate: see Rise’s response to me below. As if they weren’t aware.

Also it’s not on my credit report to help build my credit and I’m just not satisfied with this loan at all.

Not recommended unless absolutely necessary, but they do grant loans where others don\\'t.\\n\\nI updated after I spoke with Rise per their reply on my previous review, and they simply advised that the terms are as they are and nothing can or will be changed. This wasn\\'t unexpected, but the person I spoke with was professional and understanding at least.

I received a loan for $3,000 in 2019 and have not paid anything towards my principle in over a year all my payments just keep going to interest only! I am looking to pay off this loan shortly and after already paying close to $5,000 I will still have to pay over $3,000 to pay it off. This is a an extremely expensive option.

I haven’t missed a payment... I’m now finding out that my balance is $2477... after paying for over an year!... Only $66 of my$160.30 payment is going towards the actual balance!...and the other $90... is going towards INTEREST!... this is outrageous!... at this point... Rise Credit will be getting over $9000 from me if I pay until the last payment is paid.... I will never do this stupid stuff again... they are a whole rip off !... they say they are helping you... but are really helping their own pockets!.... I would not refer anyone to do this...It’s really not worth it at all...borrowed $3000... pay back ..$9000... makes no sense !...\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nThey have been very helpful to me\\nThey have been very helpful to me. I would highly recommend them to anyone\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\n1 step forward, 2steps back.\\nI started the loan during rough times and used it a few times. I was on track to pay off the last loan. My last payment should have been withdrawn and I thought it would be over. Little did I know they didn’t take the money and started taking only 1.36 each check which was twice a month. I didn’t realize as I was sick and before I knew it they dinged my credit as being 30 days past due and that was after I went in and paid it off. I will never recommend or use this again. So they helped my rebuild and then dinged it unnecessarily. Very disappointed.\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nLike a good friend!\\nAlways there when I need them!

Not knowing what it was really for or how it worked, everything was very well explained to a tee. I recieved the credit help payment and used it towards my credit cards and after a week, had already had a 13 point credit boost! Now that I have gotten the help I need, I can finally relax and allow the rebuilding process do its thing with the help of RISE!\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nSuper high Interest Rate\\nI applied for a loan because I was having issues with some medical bills due to an emergency. The interest rate is super crazy high. I understand credit limit is based on credit score but the interest is ridiculous. If didn\\'t have such bad credit then i would never applied but i needed the money. Im grateful that I could of borrowed the money but i would never do it again.\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nDONT DO IT YOU WILL GET TRAPPED TO PAY…\\nDONT DO IT YOU WILL GET TRAPPED TO PAY OFF A HIGH INTEREST LOAN🚨🚨🚨\\nGot a loan and been paying it off for 9 months and my balance has gone down a total of $300!

I said to myself this is insane!!! I continued a ON TIME payment of $277.77 for the month of March. In April I received stimulus money and decided to take that and pay it off. I called a customer service representative who told me my balance on the loan was $2685.97. I paid it and the next day received an email that my account had been paid off! A few days later, they retracted and said I need to pay my payment for 277.77 for April. What in the entire HECK! I have paid off using all of my stimulus money, I have given a total of $3519.28 for a $3000 loan I took out 3months ago. Now they said I owe $368.00 more after paying them off and have completely ruined my credit over it! Please do not do business with these people!

I do hate how high my my payback amounts are twice a month. But it’s ok because other companies charge wayyyy more! And they loaned me a lot more than I thought I would get. But when I say they have been so wonderful with the COVID relief! They have deferred my payments several times. A lot of loan companies are not doing anything or very little. My loan twice a month payments with them are the highest of my things I’m catching up on. So it’s definitely a relief that they are helping out so much. That says a lot about a company ! I’ve never missed a payment so I haven’t had any other issues I see other people complaining about. I will definitely work with this company in the future. Their customer service has always been great for me!\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nI would give them zero stars but that…\\nI would give them zero stars but that was not an option.

They will ruin your life. I have already reached out to them and they said sorry it is what it is.\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nLiteral Monsters\\nThese people are awful. They are an extremely predatory payday loan service that will absolutely screw you over. It\\'s not just insane rates. They go out of their way to make sure that something goes wrong with your payments so that they can add even more interest. I don\\'t know how the employees of this company sleep at night. The world would be a far better place if, tomorrow, they had all simply vanished.\\n\\nUPDATE They responded below and my opinion has not changed in the slightest. These people are parasites. Beware. They are also manufactuaring fake TrustPilot reviews. Take a look at the other reviews written by almost everyone who has something positive to say. They don\\'t begin to pass the smell test.\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nThe best lending company insofar as i…\\nThe best lending company insofar as i am concerned. Please keep up the good work!\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nIt’s a shame and should be illegal\\nIt’s a shame and should be illegal. I saw the interest rate on these loans, it’s insane. I don’t care what debt you’re in, you could never come out on top. Paying triple the money back. MoneyLion is a good company to build credit and borrow instant cash. When I saw the interest rate, and all the reviews where people literally thought this was appropriate to do, less knowledgeable individuals. If people are struggling and trying to establish a better route, why would they choose this company? The owners should be charge and a class act should be indicted on them. Skimming on poverty individuals, less knowledge folks to build business is not rightful. I read the last reviews and I promise you immediately I change my hold plan...\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nI’m so sick of Rise Credit\\nI’m so sick of Rise Credit! I took out a loan back in dec of 2019 with an insane interest rate around 218%! I tried canceling initially right after I accepted since there’s a 5 day grace period, but they wouldn’t cancel. I called to find out what was going on and they claimed they never received the email to cancel and it was too late. At that point, hundreds in interest had already accrued. They eventually came back saying the found the email which was annoying.\\n\\nFast forward to this year, my hours were cut like a lot of people so I had to extended the payment date a few times which didn’t help me at all because the balance jumped up to an unmanageable amount.\\n\\nSince I wasn’t late on the loan, they wouldn’t work out a settlement with me and the balance kept going up and up. They finally decided to work out a settlement (still not a reasonable offer they gave) and I ended up agreeing just because I wanted it to be over with. I paid the settlement in full on the day agreed, and they took forever to update the account. The loan still kept accruing interest after the settlement payment was made and they wouldn’t update anything.\\n\\nThey finally updated it but a few days after they did, they reported me as 30-60 days late to the credit bureaus!!!!!!!!!! The reason I had such an issue getting them to offer a settlement was because I WASNT late or past due from what they kept telling me! So how do they report me as late after we agreed to settle on a specific date and the payment was made when we agreed!?!?!?!?! They told me multiple times I couldn’t pay before the settlement date after we generated the paperwork because any payment I made at that point would not go towards the settlement.\\n\\nThey are frauds and they just want to scam people out of their money. I’ve already grossly overpaid them if I add up all of the monthly payments I made along with the settlement, now they’re trying to report me as late and they increased the balance due to a crazy amount because they continued to accrue interest after we had agreed to a settlement amount AND after I made the payment!\\n\\nThey have no compassion on anyone during this time. The company is simply worried about money and that’s it. If I’m not working like I was before all of this started and I’m struggling to survive, how can you expect customers to be able to make payments with such high interest rates?? To not even lower the payment amount it interest rates during this time is disgusting! The money I wasted paying this billion dollar company interest could really help during these difficult times.\\n\\nI just don’t understand how the interest rates offered are even legal. They actually aren’t in CA anymore and Rise won’t don’t anything to help out.\\n\\nThis company is sick and please don’t wast your time with these types of places!!!!!\\n\\nI’m currently looking into starting a class action suit in CA!\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nFake company\\nThis is a fake company that uses a machine to determine.

I kept this account open to try to build my credit up and eventually get a lower APR. You will find that they will say, “the system is automatic and you will receive an email when you’ve been accepted for a lower APR” I’ve been with them for over year now... a $1500 loan I’ve paid $9000 and no Lower APR. It’s disgusting and quite disappointed in just the overall experience. They definitely prey on people looking for a quick fix but you’re better off just working to save up than this quick “solution” you’ll pay for months to come.

That\\'s the only good thing about RISE Credit. My pay got cut in half due to less hours available to work. There was no warning whatsoever so this took me completely by surprise (October 2019). I immediately reached out to RISE to inform them of my sudden change in income and I would need a different payment arrangement. I made all my payments on time and in full and was in good standing so I thought they’d show some empathy. Maybe say \"Sure, let’s see how we can help!\" But they would not work with me on my payments for the final 3 months I had left. I\\'ll never take out a loan with them again. The customer service rep was not friendly and just didn\\'t care.\\n\\nI finally got around to making a payment. After I made the payment, they sold my account to collections. I\\'ll never be a customer of theirs again.\\n\\nUpdate to their reply:\\nYou showed no empathy to a loyal customer who always paid on time. Your reply is generic and unhelpful.

Okay in good economic times, but now the Federal Natural Disaster has been declared, and it\\'s clear many RISE customers need a different payment plan. RISE will not alter anything, sending the same standard \"payment due as you agreed\" email over and over. What felt like a helpful loan now feels predatory.

I made all of my payments on time and even paid itf off early to avoid the super high interest. Before paying the loan off, I spoke with a representative and asked if I paid out would I be able to reopen the loan. She advised that once I paid out I just had to wait 24 hours to apply again. I did exactly what she asked and was declined. I called back to ask why I was declined and the second rep I spoke with advised me that the application I filled out was for a \"refinance\" and the system did that in error. She advised to just wait until the next day and the system would allow me to apply for an actual loan again. Of course the next day the system did NOT allow me to apply again. I then called back and spoke with a 3rd rep who advised me that I was declined because of my \"credit score\" and i needed to wait 45 days to apply again. He also advised that I should of just refinanced the loan instead of paying it out, an option i was never offered in the beginning. Personally I would never deal with RISE again but if you do, be very careful and make sure you fully understand how your account works and what options are available to you.\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nWill never go back or recommend\\nI took out a loan with Rise back in 2018.

I received the confirmation message saying someone would respond, but they insist they didn’t receive it.\\n\\nI told the lady I was speaking with that I’m 10000% positive it said my message went through, and regardless I would still like to cancel because Monday would be the 5th business day so I was still within the 5 day period even if they wanted to lie and say my message wasn’t received.\\n\\nI was told that yes, it was the 5th business day, but that I missed the cut off tome to cancel!!!! No where on their website does it say there’s a time I have to call to cancel. I could understand if the place was closed, but clearly they weren’t seeing as how I was speaking to someone!! I’m so frustrated because now they are saying I owe $144 dollars in interest for a loan that I didn’t even use and tried to cancel within their grace period.\\n\\nHow in the world do I already owe $144 dollars in interest in 1 weeks time! That’s disgusting and they should be ashamed of themselves. They clearly lied saying they never received the message in order to keep me from canceling the loan just so they could rip me off and take my money.\\n\\nThey also are trying to get around the new California law that was passed and is supposed to be effective 1/1/20 that prevents loan companies from charging more than 36% in interest.\\n\\nThis company isn’t ethical and they will lie to rip you off. Please go anywhere else but here, it’s absolutely not worth it!!\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nThis for anyone new\\nThis for anyone new. The money is great to loan but be careful they do not have several things in contract that will make you take longer than expected to pay loan off. Example 2500k loan will cost you 9000k. How is this when borrowing they add interest already but charge daily interest as well depending on the state. My payment plan they will get there interest first and only after the first year.so if you pay 225 every two weeks they add 16.44 every day which equals 115 each week before you even make the first payment. As they responded to you review you will see how they advised me before hand and try to make it sound as if they did please note I\\'m not unhappy I decided to take the offer but they will respond like this. Dont sit there and respond to something I spoke the truth on. Also the customer service spoke with me and advised me that it was not in the contract but the additional interest is was the lender adds to you depending on the loan you applied for. Again nothing wrong with the loan but when you borrow be careful.\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nEasy to manage!\\nDate of experience: December 19, 2019\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nBad company\\nNo! they will not help you and no you will never get approve no need to waste your time.\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nThe site has been super user friendly.\\nDate of experience: December 16, 2019\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nEasy approval\\nEasy approval, money in my account the next day.\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nRise was on time and did everything to…\\nRise was on time and did everything to make things easy and smooth\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nEasy to work with 😀When RISE CREDIT…\\nEasy to work with 😀When RISE CREDIT says your money will be in the next day its there.

Got what I needed and was saved from losing my apartment after getting hit with dental surgery that wasn\\'t optional. Had enough left over to get my credit cards back below 30% AND pay off of a small loan I had. Maxed cards out paying bills beforehand and it wrecked my credit to below 600. Credit score will be over 700 soon. Never seen such flexible payments. I get paid bi-weekly, so my paydays are always odd dates. I was able to select that as a payment option. Payments come out the day I get my check, so I can\\'t screw this up. Wow! So impressive! Wish I never dealt with another loan company. I wish my other large loan was with Rise.

Frustratingly Unhelpful Customer Service\\nI had a great experience with my first RISE loan and was able to pay it back early, within 2 months of accepting the loan. The process was effortless. I received an invitation in the mail, entered my offer code and info and had the funds the next morning.\\n\\nUnfortunately, my experience in trying to get another loan has been beyond frustrating. I\\'m left with the feeling that RISE doesn\\'t really want me as a customer or my 150% interest.\\n\\nThe first attempt resulted in my application being closed promptly after providing verification documents with no real explanation why.\\n\\nThe second attempt (started July 9th) resulted in a \"48-business-hour\" review process that turned into 9 days. I called RISE support earlier this week and the rep ignored my questions as to why the process was taking much longer than expected. (I felt like I was talking to a recording.)\\n\\nFinally yesterday I was advised to log in to the system and review the result of the Review. I was unable to actually access the page the email directed me to view; I was sent instead to complete another application. Confused, I called support yet again and was instructed that I was approved and just needed to fill out the forms again. So I did. Which then resulted in a duplicate loan in the system and re-opening the original loan from July 9th.\\n\\nThen, I get another email advising me to provide the same documentation (ID, SS card, proof of income) I had already provided before and wait another supposed 48 business hours.\\n\\nDon\\'t bother emailing support, either. Email support is just as bad as phone support. What does that leave? Not doing business with RISE, I suppose.\\n\\nLesson learned: Approved does not actually mean approved, even if a support rep explicitly uses the phrase \"you\\'re approved\".\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nGreat customer support\\nI had some complications on my end and made things difficult for myself. They’re customer service / customer support were amazing. They were very understanding and helpful. Helped get me a solution. I will continue to refer potential customers there.\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nexcellent Service!\\nDate of experience: July 18, 2019\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nThe interest is way too high\\nThe interest is way too high.

They were very prompt, streamlined the whole process, was able to get everything done in a reasonable amount of time. They claimed to reward returning customers, with offers like better tdd rates and terms. NOT ACCURATE AT ALL. Not only was I not given ANY better rate or term, RISE apparently now has an issue with my bank and after initially approving, waited until the end of the business day to revoke that approval. And, as far as I can tell, the statements about reporting to credit bureaus is false as well, nothing from them on either of the 3. But I bet if I\\'d defaulted on my loan or been late they\\'d make sure to report that. Don\\'t buy the line about being different than other companies, they\\'re not.\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nIt\\'s a no brainer...\\nIt\\'s a no brainer if your are trying to re-establish credit quickly after a bankruptcy.

Didn\\'t have to do much to get the loan thanks a lot.\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nAbsolute worst company.\\nFor anyone looking to get a short term loan, NEVER use this company. I took out a loan for 1500, have paid back 2,669.76 to date and have two payments left. I reached out to this company about a possible settlement a few weeks ago because of a financial hardship I was facing and was given zero options. I made a similar review on the better business bureau website and they asked me to reach out to them so they could look into this account. I emailed them my issue and the response I received was that they were looking into my account and if they needed more information they would get back to me. I never got s response so I emailed again looking for a follow up. Have never heard back. They are a fine company until you look for assistance. Please do not get caught into the same mess that I have and exhaust all options before you take this loan. I have 2 payments left and will struggle through to make those just to be done with these predatory lenders. And please do not believe the responses you see from the company reaching out to resolve bad reviews, they are just attempting to look responsive.\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nService was exceptional\\nDate of experience: June 18, 2019\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nFast service\\nDate of experience: June 18, 2019\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nApplication was easy to follow and…\\nApplication was easy to follow and helped me complete my goal\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nFast and easy to apply\\nFast and easy to apply.

Just one little hitch!\\nIt was fairly easy to go through the application and to get an answer - the only thing that didn\\'t sit well with me, although it is something that needs to be said, is that every page had a disclaimer about the high fee\\'s associated with this type of loan and to not do it. I\\'m not sure if you mandated to have that information on every single page on the application or if you do that for your own personal reasons, but it\\'s annoying and it makes me feel like I shouldn\\'t want to do business with you. But that is the only thing that I had an issue with. Everything else was great!

Based on that pay date, my payment due date for the loan was set for the 15th of the month for the duration of the loan. That is a problem for me since my paycheck arrives on the 3rd Wednesday of the month, which can fall anywhere from the 15th to the 20th of the month. I asked Customer Service if I could change the scheduled loan payment date. The answer was “No”, but that I had a “7-day” grace period in which I could change the payment due date each month 2 days before the scheduled due date. Not only is that arrangement inconvenient and risky, it comes at a price: additional accrued interest.\\n\\nYou can choose to get your loan money by direct deposit with automatic loan payment withdrawals from your bank account or you can get a loan check by snail mail and pay by check. With either option Rise is betting many borrowers will missed a scheduled payment date so they’ll earn extra interest or late fees.\\n\\nSo, please, please, please read all the fine print and ask Customer Support all your questions before you push that button accepting the loan.\\n\\nBy virtue of your needing a ridiculously high interest loan, the deck is stacked against you, and Rise knows that.\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nI felt this was a bait and switch you…\\nI felt this was a bait and switch you guys have a cool program just be honest about what you can do in your letters .

If you are borrow a very small sum of money (under $1,000k) they maybe able to help you without you feeling cheated. But anything over, you will definitely pay the price. If your credit is not good, just skip over because you will be paying probably around 90% or more in interest. Know what you are getting yourself into.

Also if you are planning to request a new advance after paying off the first they say they don’t know how much your payments will be until they start taking it out?! Seriously. Their rates might be “lower” than a payday loan place or may offer more money than payday loans but they are just as greedy as the next.

I have paid $3465.19 to this day and still owe $3257.51 which will prob increase due to the interest rate. Shows it will not be paid off until the end of January 2020. I had the option to refinance and get possibly a lower interest rate and bam it was higher. I will NOT refinance nor recommend nor take out another loan when this miserable loan is done. I have also made additional payments and they just deduct that from my bi weekly payment so that doesn\\'t help. This is not a good place for a loan!!!

There was always something else holding up the process. I log onto my email this morning after another email I had sent asking what the status was and I was told I had to reapply. WHAT!!! are you kidding me. I did all the right things emailed the documentation to them and had to constantly follow up just to be asked for additional information.

I didn’t believe it at first and didn’t apply since I get mail offers all the time! I hate doing online loans most time cuz most ask for so much paperwork and by then I quit cuz it’s not worth it!\\nI honestly make good money, don’t pay a mortgage since I live with family that helps\\nWith my kids. The reasons why I tried this was to see if truly this was going to work as it stated! I have had bad credit due to long ago medical bills! All the bad reports are medical bills! And also I have not checked my credit for last 5 years! Thanks to RISE i decided to check my reports and omg, there were so many mistakes on it! So out of curiousness I applied! All it did was ask me simple questions, basics! Then it asked how much I made, where I worked, and to fill in my checking account info\\nThen it took me to a page that stated I was approved! Then had me go through several legal documents to check mark and also let me see exactly what I was approved for, how much each monthly payment would be, and the terms! I even had the choice to choose a smaller loan amount, and either faster payoff terms or longer! I loved that RISE gave me\\nThe option to choose what amounts I wanted to really borrow! Either take the $3000 or less. It was all up to me!\\nYes it’s high in payback, and something I normally would never take as a loan but I now know of RISE in case of any future emergency and I now know they are very transparent and give you plenty of chances to take the loan or not! That to me tells me they truly are here to\\nHelp those that need help! And are really not\\nAbout taking your money! They give you many opportunities to back out even a no risk 5 day cancellation after your funding too if you change your mind!\\nYou can’t complain about the fees when your the one that is desperate for help that no other company will give you! If you don’t like the fees of paying back the loan no one said you had to ask for the help! But don’t ask for help then complain or give 1-2 stars cuz the rate! They gave me fair and plenty of information on how this is for emergencies and even tell you other ways to loan for less fees and interest!\\nI didn’t need this in desperate measures but I took a loan and will surely pay back each month and I did it cuz it is rare to have a company trust those who have a horrible credit score when no one else will and in such very simple ways! It took me 10 minutes to apply! That is it and I did not have to turn in any documents at all and money will be in next business day!\\nI don’t work for Rise or represent them I am just a Normal person, it was my choice to write this and I wanted to cuz it’s beyond me that people could sit here and complain or give less than 5 stars for taking a loan, getting help from RISE knowing full well the costs of the payback the percentage rate etc! They were more than overly transparent! If you thought the rate, or monthly payment was high then why do\\nYou take the help no one else will give you then insult the people who helped you and by no means of hiding anything!\\nI just went through the process, and I was told\\nMore than needed that this was a loan for urgent needs thus higher and more expensive rates! They don’t hide that! And they let you know this throughout the entire process to make sure you know!\\nSo to all those who take the help of someone that offers and gives you help that no one else will, and you take it. Then you complain! Wow\\nGreat way of disrespecting the company that helped you when no one else probably and most likely didn’t! I know how it is when times are hard, we all do. No one has a perfect life, one day you can have a great job and make great money and it can be gone the next in a flash! So it is beyond important to be humble, and not to let money change you for the worst! Money is evil and it is the #1 thing that can turn brother against brother and wife against a husband! That is powerful! I once was at a great place, it took one car accident to turn my life 360! Going from independence to dependence! The fact that your so desperate to have to ask friends and family it can bring a persons soul in a dark and unhappy place! Some are lucky they have people they know who will and can afford to help, but know that when you do borrow and ask for help, there is always going to be a thought in your mind that you owe that person more than the money you borrowed! It’s better to ask for help with programs like RISE! There is no personal attachment or that “I owe you forever and will do anything for you for what you did” feeling! Cuz if that person you did get help from ever has something they can’t do themselves, best believe that you will be that person they will turn to! Take only what you need! And borrow here the exact amount that will help you, and use it to get out of whatever bad spot your in! RISE approved exactly what they said they would, and in 10 min I was approved and confirmed for next business day deposit! I am\\nGlad that I chose to try it out cuz now I know one company that will truly help when I need it and faster than any bank!\\nRise your a saint! Thanks for all the help and for giving so many people the chance to rebuild their credit and to get out of emergency situations!! I don’t know how it is that you will trust all of use that have shown not so great credit, but I believe it is cuz you too may have once been in a spot where you had no help! Perhaps the owner knows how it is to be so desperate for help and not get it! RISE I give you blessings for the countless people you have saved , when in their darkest moments of desperation! Your a saint and your name says it all! RISE from your sadness and hopelessness and then keep rising to a better place!\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nFast and Smart\\nRise Credit is the one company that I have trusted the most.

I was told that I needed to send the email which I informed them I did the night before.

All of a sudden I had to make payment arrangements with them and they could no longer extend the payments. I had lost all of my income and couldn’t pay any longer. I called them and they told me that I had signed the paperwork and there was nothing they could do about changing the rules. Yes they can, it’s their company. Instead they just wanted all the fees and interest to keep accruing because anything that goes over the $2500 value they can charge what they want to. Everything under that to a $2500 cap off they would have have to keep its payments and fees minimal. It’s the law. I had borrowed $3000 and paid well over $1600 back. I went to a consolidation company and then RISE waited 59-68 days to add it to my credit report. That’s a shame!!!

When I went into her checking account, I saw that she recently received a $1,500 deposit from Rise. She was too proud to tell me she was struggling, got a preapproved offer from Rise and went for it thinking they\\'d approve her for $500 or something. At 77 years old, she lives on only her meager $600 social security checks each month. Yet somehow...Rise approved her for a $1,500 loan this month. Um. She gets $600 a month?! And the interest rate is downright obscene. So now, they\\'ll take more than half of her monthly income for the next year until the loan plus interest is paid.\\n\\nThe fact that Rise approved her on $600 a month income derived solely from Social Security is the epitome of predatory lending. Not to mention, she lives in Arizona where Rise supposedly does not even do business. Not sure how that happened - her income statement, drivers license, etc. all show AZ as her place of residence. I\\'ve just contacted the Attorney General in Arizona, and am going to make sure I cause as much ruckus as I can about this company and their illegal tactics to prey on seniors.\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nI have had a good experience with RISE…\\nI have had a good experience with RISE staff, all very polite and helpful.\\nThanks for giving me a loan.

It was several days of back and forth over documentation and they were not quick about notifying you when they were not satisfied with documents submitted. All three times notifications were sent, it was after the cut-off date for receiving information which pushed completion of my application several more days after the request.

However, upon doing so through their website, the requirements are to use Google Chrome, which I already have, Yet, chrome wasn\\'t what it needed at all. Within chrome, none of the drop down boxes would work and no information could be put in, and at the bottom of the page it would display \" processing\" ! You can\\'t process if no information is input into the system. This was on a Saturday, called and the employee , friendly, walked through it all and again stated that chrome was the browser to be used. All setting on my end were checked and double checked to ensure nothing was being blocked and was being performed correctly. Therefore, the loan could not be processed and an \"issue ticket\" was ordered and submitted to their IT dept to find out what the problem was. The problem was their end, without any doubt ( I work in IT )\\nWith it being on the weekend , it would be Monday before it would be addressed and fixed and was told an email would be sent to confirm. By Tuesday, no email, no call and I called to inquire, was told by a rude girl that a ticket was put in and would be fixed, I asked for it to be escalated and was rudely told that any ticket submitted was escalated . ( which only means, first come, first served ) No one could seem to explain why this was happening, perhaps speaking to the IT person would have been a better solution, but that was not an option, this company prefers to communicate via email ONLY, not a good practice as some may not have access to Internet at all times. But was told it would be fixed and notified by next day ( Wed) It\\'s currently Thursday and still no money ! However, something told me to try Internet Explorer and BOOM it worked ! Was able to complete the application and it was being processed ! Great . right ? NOPE ! Received an email that the problem was fixed and the account was reset and I had to go back and re-apply ! Nooo, it had already been done through Internet Explorer and and was processing and re-applying was NOT an option ! So, fotthe amount of money you are raping people for, how about possibly paying for some REAL Internet Technicians that know what they are doing ! Nothing worse than the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing ! COMMINICATE with each other internally and with the customer, test your systems on all browsers and educate yourselves, clearly you don\\'t have a good system and your emplyess needs better training !\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nSo fast and helped me a lot.\\nDate of experience: August 16, 2018\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nFast easy organized\\nDate of experience: August 16, 2018\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nDENIED FOR THE 3rd TIME\\nDENIED FOR THE 3rd TIME.

This time, another REP told me to wait 45 days. I\\'m quite positive it\\'s because they didn\\'t make any money off of me as I paid it off early. Don\\'t waste your time with these people!\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nThis is a horrible company!\\nThis is a horrible company!! They are taking out over $279 twice a month killing my bank account and causing fees with my bank!!\\n\\nRISEcredit.com\\nMade me miss my Nephew’s Wedding coz I couldn’t refinance... Then the next month I could?! Wrong Just Wrong!\\nHours are awful, everything is too automated no real people handling your issues. Said I could set my own due date but kept from the date I got my loan kept they set my due date before the date I got paid every month despite what I told them. Then when I really needed to re-finance my loan they said I couldn’t lol 😂 because I had been late on a payment?! Funny thing is they always got their money I just had to call to change the date stressed out until they finally just gave me a regular date on the day I wanted originally. Sad 😞 thing is I had to miss my nephews wedding but that’s the life of a disabled person! I did appreciate that they were there! So I didn’t give them a 1 but I was pretty upset when the following month after I was told that I couldn’t refinance my loan that they wanted to refinance. I ended up missing a pretty special wedding 🎩 sad smh 🤦\\u200d♂️!!! Aggravated enough that I won’t be back, & I won’t recommend Rise to anyone...

Because we had to do all of this, and she did not have it set up I was over 40 min late getting back to work.

I called and listened to their garbage automated phone system that would not recognize voice commands (as they said it would) and none of the options listed by the phone system provided anything remotely related to unlocking an account. The automated phone system eventually hung up on me. When I called back again, I just picked an option hoping the Customer Service Representative would be able to transfer me to the correct person. My call was answered by someone with a very thick Indian accent that had me verify my account information. She was able to transfer me to someone who could reset my account, but I had to wait on hold for a very long time.

Even with good credit score they still get you with high interest rate and the longer your loan, the more high interests they “rob” you of your hard earned money. I learned my lesson of borrowing money from loan companies like OneMain Financial, stay away from it , never again!!!\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nEverything was done over phone\\nDate of experience: March 05, 2024\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nExperienced staff\\nJamie was super helpful, knowledgeable and friendly.

Great service.\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nThe workers were very patient and…\\nThe workers were very patient and helpful Heather went above and beyond .Thank you all!\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nReviews are for sure paid for\\nThere is NO WAY One Main has a TrustPilot rating this high. Most people I know who have used them have had SOME issue with them.\\n\\nI had a loan with them in 2021 for about $5k. I paid it off in 6 months by coincidence because my VA case settled and I received a large sum of money.\\n\\nFast forward to today, I was looking at my credit report and noticed that in my Transunion section, they remarked my loan with them as “ Canceled by credit grantor”. Might seem benign right? CANCELED is not typically used on loans that have been paid off correctly. CANCELED by credit grantor is often associated with something bad on your credit report. These little details matter.\\n\\nI disputed it and of course, they couldn’t change it. What is an absolute minor detail for them, and a major one for me, they couldn’t change.\\n\\nDO NOT GO WITH ONE MAIN. Their entire business model is designed around enslaving desperate people into loans with excruciatingly high interest that you will never be able to pay off. And if you do pay it off, they will get their last lick by reflecting it poorly on your credit.\\n\\nAgain, these amount of positive reviews have GOT TO BE PAID.\\n\\nEDIT FOR FUTURE VIEWERS: NOTICE how they took the time to respond to the claim of paid reviews, but could give FK all about their mishandling of my credit report?

They perform the old switcheroo on you after they promise you\\'ll get a certain amount. Then they run your credit and fail to deliver what was promised. Furthermore, if you encounter hardships, they do not offer assistance; they put you on hold and then disconnect the call, pretending the line dropped while I\\'m at home on WiFi. They are a company filled with scam artists determined to exploit consumers. They misrepresent interest rates and do not clarify that it\\'s a computed rate, ensuring that every month the CEOs benefit at your expense. If you do miss a payment, don\\'t worry, they\\'ll immediately report you as delinquent to all credit bureaus. They fail to report accurate information; while a dispute may remove it, it\\'s the process that\\'s burdensome. They engage in harassment and deceit, claiming they are here to help while they take advantage of you.\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nAmazing\\nAmazing!

I was supposed to get it last Wednesday and it was not deposited into my account. After 3 days of waiting, they told me I can pick up a check in person. I picked up the check and went to the bank to deposit it and it still has a hold on it until the 24th. I needed the funds to fix my car. We are in a worse situation now because we haven’t been able to pay for the repairs on my car so they are still holding it until I am able to pay to pick it up. So it’s been very hard on us financially not being able to get to work and having to take a Lyft every day to and from work. Very unreliable. When I signed the loan agreement over a week ago, I was told it would be deposited into my checking account the next day and when it wasn’t, they made me wait 3 days….

The location I bought the car from only offered OneMain Financial auto financing, and so I bought the car on a Saturday, and re-financed Monday morning with a 5.9% interest rate. I would never recommend OneMain Financial to anyone...to me, it is the Pawn Shop or Pay Day Loans of auto financing. (I must admit I laughed at the reply to this post from OneMain...apparently a credit score of 784 and a very good income means a 20% interest rate is justified. Hilarious! The bank I re-financed with were shocked at such an absurd interest rate. Do your homework!)\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nVery smooth and fast process\\nThis process was very quick and easy.

Do NOT recommend!!!\\nSHADY AF!!! These people just want to steal your money and ruin your life, do not fall for the BS stories on Credit Karma. They’re just as shady. It’s all lies. What they want is for you to use your brand new car as collateral for a loan with exorbitant interest rates. The rates are so high that they want you to intentionally not make your payments so they can come and collect your car from you. This is not a good company to get a loan for they are extremely shady. Consumer beware!!!! Watch out for Kayla, she’s a legitimate SNAKE!!!\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nAll lies\\nAll lies , my credit score is about 600. No late payments for over 4 years and I got denied\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nSlow service\\nI have had this loan for a month and my car has not been paid off. I can not get a straight answer as to why, except for snail mail. Why would you pay to expedite my title and not pay to expedite a $4700.00 check?!? In the meantime I’m making two payments. This is not about me making payments, its about your company not paying off my original car loan in a timely manner, now I’m paying you and my previous creditor both for the same car!\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nOne main financial not a good credit place\\nI had never missed a payment.\\nI was diagnosed with prostate cancer. Let them know what was going that I was going to have surgery and I was waiting on my SDI. I was told not to worry just keep them updated.\\nI did everything they told me to. Yet after I paid them off they put that I missed payments on my credit.\\nThis was very unfair.\\nI will never use them or recommend them to anyone.\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nExcellent customer service\\nFrom beginning to end my experience was great. Working with Betty she made my day. Betty was so attentive and her customer service was second to none. She had everything already prepared so when I got to the office it was smooth sailing.\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nMy experience was absolutely great but…\\nMy experience was absolutely great but I was expecting no less since I have used One main financial in the past and was always satisfied with the service.\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nI have used One Main on both sides of…\\nI have used One Main on both sides of the country (CA and PA) and wow, I am extremely impressed by the professionalism, ease, and expertise by every single employee I have encountered. They are so helpful and friendly and answer all of my (anxiety-inducing) questions. I can call them or walk in, and never have to wait to speak with someone. I highly recommend and will continue to use One Main going forward.\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nShe’s lovely\\nShe was very kind and helped me alot very blessed to have had such a great person help me get my first car\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nOne Main blocked my account for a one…\\nOne Main blocked my account for a one dollar dispute. My card is frozen now for months but brightway continues to charge me. I called a spoke with someone who had trouble understanding me but said my account cannot be unblocked until problem is resolved. I said I’ll pay the one dollar so you can resolve problem the agent said that she could not do that. Today I called again a man with a similar speech pattern gave me the same run around with no way of resolving their problem. If you’re online looking for credit help be very careful of those offering lower interest and lower annual payments. In the are located in small out of the way cities and states and they outsource their services to foreign countries, think twice. I’ve had several Seniors come to me for assistance with these problems. Brightway, OneMain is on top of the list. Some of us Veterans return from the Middle East with credit problems and this is the assistance we receive. Please be careful.\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nVery easy process and pleasant experience\\nVery easy process and knowledge\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nPrequalifying will hurt your credit unlike the website that says soft pull.\\nMy husband and I where looking to consolidate some bills and decided to do the prequalify that said was a soft credit pull . We hadn\\'t even applied for the loan and they did a hard pull on his credit. I called customer service and she was very rude. Would not let me speak and kept interrupting me. She could not answer any questions and was no help at all. So I quess now we are out of luck because if we apply it will hard pull again. It should not say this wont affect your credit because that is not true.

Limited Credit File and 2. No credit file. I have 40+ years of credit and perfect payments for over 20+ years and have Good credit and do not need to fix it. Called to talk to someone about it in Tucson Arizona at 6781 N Thornydale Rd. #243 Tucson AZ. I believe the person was named \"Jackie\", not sure. I told her what happened and even mentioned I had taken out a loan last year at that location and even paid it off early. She told me yep that\\'s what happens, made it very clear she was not interested in looking at the situation or helping me at all. I was made offers by several other companies but wanted to do business with this one since everything went very smooth the last time. I know there had to have been a glitch since the system was having problems recognizing my social security number for my account but they obviously do not care and assume that anyone calling about being rejected must automatically have bad credit. I do not usually respond to things but the person was so quick to get rid of me on the phone and not wanting to hear anything more I felt it needed to be addressed. Not that missing out on my business will make a difference to a company this size.\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nOutstanding Customer Service\\nTakiyah was absolutely amazing.

They pretend to help people (like my friend) but ultimately don’t.\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nOne Main Financial is a deceptive loan…\\nOne Main Financial is a deceptive loan company. I had purchased an involuntary termination insurance policy that was canceled without my knowledge. I was told the policy was canceled because I had been involuntary terminated within 30 days of when the policy was purchased. Of course, One Main Financial failed to mention this one very important detail during its sales pitch.\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nMore hassle than it\\'s worth\\nSo I found this company through credit Karma, CK said it would be easy and high approval odds. So I did the process. They seemed nice at first, but as I went through the process, it was very cumbersome and they would keep asking for additional information - I would give it to them and then they would say \"oh we need this now\". After many times I just got fed up with it. I wish they would just tell you exactly what is needed from the get go instead of a week long painful experience. I went with Midwest Regional Finance instead and it was easy peasy and got a loan for $12,000 in a couple of hours.\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nGreat Service\\nFrom the first phone call to the end of the process everything was smooth and easy. The person I spoke with was amazing and non-judgmental. She was very well informed and answered my questions without hesitation.\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nHassle-Free\\nMy agent worked diligently with me to get the most loan amount available to me and was patient with me.

Also, payment options are super slim to adding your bank account details, what if I just want ro process a debit transaction.. that\\'s A no... Not sure about all the other super extra positive reviews but this is my honest opinion/ review.. This company as a whole can really do better starting with there customer service PLEASE. We should not be on hold the same length as a work shift just to get simple help. Because everything in the App points you to call and sir on hold but in return receive little to no help.\\n\\nMy biggest mistake.\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nThe incredible genuine service from…\\nThe incredible genuine service from Shantey and also Jackie. They had no problem with me grilling them about the loan I was applying for.\\nThey were patient and they responded with clear cut answers and no hidden clauses in the contract that could present a problem down the road.\\nI absolutely am happy with my decision to go forward with my loan.\\nIt helped take so much stress out of my life.\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nBad communication and messed up procedures\\nI had a loan with OneMain, it’s been on automatic payments from day one and I wasn’t late nor did I miss one payment. The last payment on my loan they didn’t take the proper amount, the payment left a balance of 24 cents. So instead of making an automatic payment of 24 cents the next month they didn’t do anything, didn’t contact me, nothing. Then the following month they reported my account as delinquent to the credit bureaus, really messing up my credit score. For 24 cents!!!!! I will never understand why they didn’t adjust the last payment 24 cents higher to pay off the loan totally, or at least contact me in some manner regarding the 24 cent balance. The only way I discovered this was a notification from a credit bureau saying I had a delinquent account and my credit score had gone down. Seriously!! Based on my experience I would never use this company ever. Borrower beware!!\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nExtremely grateful and thankful\\nChristy and the green tree office was so careful and patient and helpful. She did a wonderful job.

We paid for the insurance in case my husband went on unemployment. He\\'s a union worker. We had to use the insurance from 10/23-12/23. The insurance company made the FULL payments, but OneMain continued to also pull it from my account.\\nI am currently paid ahead until March 1st.\\nThis morning I spoke to find ANOTHER $285.50 taken from my account even though my online account and statement both state I\\'m paid ahead until 3/1/24. This payment they took today caused my electric bill to bounce. I\\'m completely disabled and have a small child, and they won\\'t give me the money back. They have taken $856 out of my account since October that wasn\\'t owed to them. DO NOT USE THIS LOAN COMPANY. THEY ARE THIEVES!!!!!!!!\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nGreat customer service.

Tried to refinance my loan, every payment on time, and when they updated my information, my income had increased, and I no longer have a car payment. They said no without ANY EXPLANATION whatsoever. It\\'s like they didn\\'t take into account that ALL my accounts are not only current, but I\\'ve not been late on any . I think it\\'s BS, and if I had it to do over, I wouldn\\'t use them, I\\'d look elsewhere, and you should too. UPDATE!! One Main asked me to call them, I did, and I discovered that 1. Being an existing customer with on time payment history DOESN\\'T MATTER to them. 2. Your application isn\\'t even checked by a real person, a computer makes the final decision. Just wondering if my AGE is a factor...hmmm Stay far far away from doing business with this company. Update #2.. more BS, they acknowledged that I have a perfect payment history, not only with them but my other accounts, but their \"computer said I was some sort of risk. I can\\'t say it enough, STAY AWAY, LOOK ELSEWHERE!!\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nsmooth and timely\\nsmooth and timely.

My credit suffered as several Hard Inquiries were placed on my report. After contacting and calling these institutions over the past year, all of the inquiries were removed. All the companies that were duped, removed their mistakes from my report. Except OneMain Financial. They refuse to admit they were wrong and correct their mistake. A lending institution that can\\'t admit they made a mistake, is a company that can\\'t be trusted. One Main is the only lender who refuses to stand corrected. This is one arrogant company not interested in making things right.

Cant say the same for OneMain in general. I wish your company as a whole, cared for their clients as much as the individual representatives make us feel. You\\'re charging me an EXTREMELY high interest. PLUS I found out that the insurance you\\'re making me purchase is a voluntary action.

They never call you to make payment arrangements but they call wanting you to just make a payment instead.\\nCathy is beyond rude and shouldnt be working in customer service. I had to call them after hours and basically yell at them to quit calling my phone 4 to 6 times daily...now they only call me twice a day but it is always after 6pm cause they think I am home.\\nOnce my loan is paid off I will never use One Main again. Until they learn what harassment is and revamp the way they contact individuals that are hard to reach I will never give them other than a terrible review. They even call on Saturdays and Sundays, all the time.\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nSorry excuse for a business and bank.\\nI review businesses and products some for rebates some after they give you a loan or whatever you\\'re happy you need the money so you go out and you give them a positive review I would not recommend One main financial to a dog I started to get a personal loan through them myself their interest rate yes depending up on your credit nonetheless are through the roof take advantage of people really needing money but when I really saw how sorry low down pathetic and good for nothing they were when my old man\\'s laying in the hospital after having a heart attack this sorry excuse for a company calls and he tells I\\'m in hosting Valley like been transported to another hospital oh well we really need to get your payment no m*********** no matter what your job is you need to get your s*** together and say you know we understand your sick right now call us as soon as you get out there\\'s no excuse for being a sorry human being and there\\'s no company needs their money that bad if it was three four months behind I could see a day late a day late. So if you go when you\\'re desperate need for a loan Carla whatever it is that your money need maybe and later on something happens this is not going to be the bank that says oh let me look at my computer and see how we can help you we\\'ve been a customer of ours for years or anything else it\\'s going to be Where\\'s My money where\\'s my money\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nThe interest rate is outrageous\\nThe interest rate is outrageous.

Also, need to try and work more with their customers when they are having financial issues. Need better ways of paying off the loan other than just simply refinancing back for another 5 years of their life. The interest is crazy on these loans as well and if you use a car for the collateral you should be able to have a pay off on that car incase you are needing to get another car.

Called and so many excuses and always someone else’s fault. Called the corporate office and now they are supposedly sending me a lean release for me to have to go to DMV to get a title which I will have to pay for! So don’t do a title loan with this company for when y’all pay it off you will have to do the leg work just to get it back.

To get the collateral, I would have to borrow enough to pay off my car (approx $8,000) and then use my car as collateral for the $4,000 that I needed. So basically, you\\'re asking me to borrow $12,000 for the sake of needing $4,000. To best is that the interest rate on the $8,000 to pay off my car would be higher than the interest rate I\\'m paying now on the car loan!

My wife and I were approved for a loan amount of $12,368 based on the value of my wife\\'s car. As part of the loan process, One Main requested that a loan to Wells Fargo issued in my name which I was not keen on doing. Supposedly, a check was mailed to Wells Fargo in the amount of $3,939.00 to pay off loan. As of today (01/13/2024), the check has not been received by Wells Fargo. One Main Financial has offered every excuse in the world to say that the check was indeed mailed on 12/28/2023. They have even claimed that Wells Fargo may be holding the check to make sure it is a good check. Even if that is so, the time for that to have occurred has already passed by. One Main Financial has refused to do anything except make sure that I will make their payment on the designated due date. i have contacted Wells Fargo to be on the lookout for the check. One Main Financial should step up and do a thorough investigation into where the check is. The check has surely have had enough time to be posted to my account at Wells Fargo. One Main has stated that their check writing company has confirmed and has offered to do a stop payment on the check after 30 days. That act would mean that I will have to make another installment payment to Wells Fargo plus make two payments to One Main Financial during that same thirty day period. That suggestion is ludicrous.\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nI enjoyed our visit with misty she was…\\nI enjoyed our visit with misty she was very helpful in explaining everything to us, she was really nice.\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nQuick and friendly service.\\nDate of experience: January 04, 2024\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nEverything was great!!!\\nDate of experience: January 04, 2024\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nDisappointed and sad…\\nI applied for a loan four times since it was difficult to get all the ducks in a row.

I was told a family member could use their vehicle as collateral but I wasn\\'t told over several weeks that the vehicle must be paid off if loan amount small. I don\\'t consider $5,000 to be a small amount but that\\'s what was still owed on the vehicle. I feel like Jason dropped the ball and wasn\\'t honest from the beginning. We were not approved for a loan so that\\'s it but it would have been nice to know this weeks ago.

They do not have a good customer service. They do not do what they say they are going to do and now I’m gonna have to get a lawyer to get my title to my truck released. Please be careful do not get a loan, once you in, you’ll never get out again I have had alone with them for so many years. I’m ashamed of it I should never had to use them.

It only takes a second to follow through and say hey I don’t have any update or I’m gonna be busy. Just wanted to let you know once I’m done I will give you a call. I was the one always having to reach out. I transferred my business to the OneMain Financial in Grayson, Georgia and me and my wife dealt with Summer☀️ who was a complete delight she did everything she said she would do, she followed through, no matter what her circumstances was she took care of her customer, which made a world a difference to me and my wife anyone who knows me knows that I am the nicest guy in the world but when I know someone is lying to me I will call them out on that , my business will forever be with Summer☀️ at the Grayson Georgia location.

This has nothing to do with the lady that helped me out with the loan. She was great she was nice I just feel like I was a little deceived. I got a loan back in the end of May beginning of June 2023 I initially reached out for a $5000 loan. After talking to her and giving me options somehow Went ahead and accepted the 8.5 thousand loan that she mentioned. Going through the paperwork I don’t remember being told that my interest rate was almost as much as the loan. For a 8.k loan, my interest rate is about 6.2k so after getting the loan I’m now paying back 14,000 opposed to the 8.5. I know interest exists, but 23% is ridiculous. What I will say is if you do this online or over the phone read everything over yourself because they do screen share (with your permission, of course) but don’t allow them to say oh well this screen just tells you xyz and scroll through. No read it yourself because if I would’ve saw that I had to pay back double almost double of what I was getting. I would’ve never signed that loan\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nExcellence\\nExcellence, professionalism,\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nMy loan agent was wonder\\nDate of experience: January 04, 2024\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nThe loan was quick and easy\\nThe loan was quick and easy.

Samsung Android user.\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nThey are very helpful and kind\\nDate of experience: January 04, 2024\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nBetrayed and juked just in time for the Holiday and ruin my new Year coming in.\\nI asked for the total amount available, as I added another vehicle for collateral, and on top of the money needed I was in negotiations for a deal on some property, so I was going to hold back that money for that land deal. I figured if it didn\\'t work out I could just put it in savings until another deal came up. It would also always be available for emergencies or make extra payments.\\nWell when it came to close the loan the gave me 2 choices one for a lesser amount and one for the full amount. The loan for the lesser amount was 2% higher on the interest rate, and I explained my reasoning and then felt pressured to accept the lesser amount and I asked her if I was able to get the land deal negotiated could I come back and get the loan I originally requested and she said, sure it wouldn\\'t be a problem.\\nAs soon as I got the land deal worked out. I texted an 812 number that they had contacted me on, when they had an issue depositing the money from the loan for the lesser amount, and requested me come back for a check. Then I had issues with the check at first. But was finally able to cash after a couple hours. So with the branch being closed for a long holiday weekend. I thought the 812 number may be the branch manager so I wanted to let her know right away I needed to change the loan.\\nI had put $3300 of the money I just borrowed down to hold the property knowing i could get the remaining $700 from the new loan as well as the money need for the items originally.\\nNow she won\\'t refund the money but is allowing me 2 months to come up with remaining money for the property or lose that cash. Now I\\'m stressed and trying to hustle up to cover all of it. They said the reason for denial was that One Main Financial would like to see me make a payment on a loan first... Are you kidding me 2 loans paid off with minimal issues on my payments. Before they took my other collateral and their Holiday commission, I was a valued customer now I\\'m treated as a complete stranger and a value to nobody\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nI appreciate the ease of doing all the…\\nI appreciate the ease of doing all the paperwork online.

I reached out to the company to see if they had a settlement program to help with the monthly payment. They told me yes and got me all set up, I made the first payment right away. Well apparently they don’t actually update anything in their system and so 30 days later I find a late payment ding on my credit report. The only thing they actually updated was to make sure and put on my credit report they the account is being managed through a debt settlement company. Which it’s not. It’s still being managed by One Main. I call the company to find out what that’s about because I’m not actually 30 days late. They told me nothing actually changes in the system and that yes every month I don’t make the initial agreed upon payment I will get a late payment ding on my credit report. Unless I want to go back to paying the original amount. So they don’t actually help at all. They didn’t tell me this information when I signed up for the settlement. Just let me go ahead and take the hit and then tell me there’s nothing they can do for me. The local office never answers their phone or returns phone calls. Don’t take any loans from\\nThis company unless you want to be paying them for the rest of forever. They’ve already made plenty of money off of me.

You apply and get approved and guess what it jumps to 18.6% for 5 years. Not bad almost $3500 interest. Not bad for someone that is desperate that is. I asked where the 15.4% I was offered at 60 months. She said hold on and come back and said I can do that at 36 months and your payment go up at almost $100 month. lol. If you’re even semi educated you can see where I’m going with this.

Even when I made multiple payments they still call non-stop. The last young lady was beyond rude when she asked me about surrendering my car for a payment of $123. Not only that, they callled me countless times per day about being late on my payment, which I was not, and explained to her that it comes out on the 15th of every month which she could see on her system, but she pushed back and continued to be extremely rude without looking at what date my payments came out. After making a payment, my normal payment which I was not behind on, I made an additional $100 payment and they still continued to call me repeatedly. Oone Main responded to my initial review, but took no accountability for their rude employees calling me countless times, all they said was be sure to keep my account current, which it was/is.\\n\\nAgain, stay away if you can, I made a huge mistake getting a loan with One Main Financial. Seek a company that shows respect to their customers, especially at the interest rates they charge. Again, a big mistake on my end, if I woud have know this is how they would treat me, I would have gone elswhere with my business. I will never again do business with the most rude and unprofessional One Main Financial. I hope this helps someone to avoid what I have experienced!\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nThis company lied to me\\nThis company lied to me. Two weeks after I took out a loan on my car. I wanted to cancel gap insurance… They said I could not. It’s against company policy. I am handicapped mentally, and physically. I had to let my car go back because the payments were too high. They loaned me $12,000 on it and six months later I had the car appraised at two different car lots and they offered me between $8000 and $9000 to purchase it. It was a 2014 Nissan pathfinder with a brand new $5000 transmission less than six months old. I received a letter from them today saying that sold it at auction for $800… Ridiculous! I was in the automobile business for 50 years before my wife was murdered and I had to retire.\\nI will spend the rest of my days on this earth, telling everyone that gives me two minutes to talk to them.… To stay away from this company…they lie, and now they are trying to steal from a handicap person by saying my car was worth only $800, I wonder who’s friend bought the car at the auction. If you were done this way by this company too…. Please contact me at my email…\\nThere are laws and organizations that will help you and protect us from people like this, and I will put you in contact with them.\\nOn May 31, 2023, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) issued an order against OneMain Financial Holdings, LLC; OneMain Financial Group, LLC; OneMain Financial (HI), Inc.; OneMain Financial, Inc.; and OneMain Financial of Minnesota, Inc. (collectively referred to as OneMain). OneMain is an Indiana-based personal loan installment lender with more than 1,400 branches across 44 states. In connection with loan originations and renewals, OneMain markets, sells, and finances add-on products, including credit life insurance, credit disability insurance, and identity theft protection. For several years, OneMain misrepresented to tens of thousands of consumers who purchased and then subsequently canceled optional add-on products that they could cancel the products during what it called a “full refund period” and be returned to the financial position they would have been in had the product never been added to their loan. The Bureau found that OneMain engaged in deceptive acts or practices in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA) by misleading consumers into believing they must purchase add-on products to receive loans and that they could cancel the add-on products within a prescribed time period without cost. The Bureau also found that OneMain engaged in unfair acts or practices in violation of the CFPA by charging and failing to refund the full premium and interest that accrued on add-on products consumers did not agree to purchase and by charging and failing to refund interest that accrued on add-on product fees during a purported full-refund period. Finally, the Bureau found that OneMain violated the CFPA by abusively interfering with consumers’ ability to understand that add-on products were optional and that OneMain charged non-refundable interest during the purported full-refund period. The order requires OneMain to stop its unlawful activities, adjust its policies to make cancellation of add-on products easier, include interest in refunds after add-on product cancellations, pay at least $10,000,000 in consumer redress, and pay a $10,000,000 civil money penalty. OneMain must also take measures to ensure future compliance.\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nMy service rep made me feel at ease and…\\nMy service rep made me feel at ease and guided me through every step. She was knowledgeable, friendly and efficient.\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nCompany was good awhile ago but…\\nCompany was good awhile ago but interested skyrocket. I applied again and was denied a year ago. Received an invitation to reapply. Got denied again and received a bad remark on my credit score. I immediately called the company who a representative took me off call list but rerouted me to a sells representative. I explained my issue and she instantly hung up on me. It was very rude and I really wanted to know why send an invitation if I had been denied a year ago. I unfortunately didn\\'t get my answer but a slap on the face. But yes this are the reasons why I\\'m leaving a bad review.\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nGo with a different company\\nAbsolute nightmare to work with and ruined my credit score. Made me jump through hoops and required a lot of information. Someone told me that one main put themselves as lienholders on her vehicle before even signing a contract. I went through a different company suggested through TurboTax and got a much better rate and sign up was painless. They didn\\'t require any additional documents.\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nThis company has screwed my credit up…\\nThis company has screwed my credit up by making me apply for them twice, just to find out there not going to approve me for my loan. I have been on the run around for two and a half weeks with them and then they try to tell me they can’t approve me because of my credit has a decrease. But that’s because they made me apply for them twice, so of course it’s going to dip. I’ve always paid my bills. I actively have two car loans that I’m paying and I’ve never paid them late but for some reason this company won’t approve me for a loan even know they gave me an excellent chance of approval. I will no longer do business with this company or refer anyone to them. Plz save your time and look for a loan somewhere else.\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nChanging Information\\nI received an automated message that I had good approval odds through One Main.\\n\\nI applied online and saw the note saying I would only have a soft credit pull. I was given the option of a secured and unsecured loan online. All seemed good until I applied, the credit pull was a hard pull, and after getting a message of approval of the loan with the hard credit pull I was told I would need to provide info for a secured loan.\\n\\nI scheduled a call which never came, called them myself and was asked to provide all the same info again. I was told that there may not be offers for me and was still asked to provide vehicle info after I stated I did not want a secured loan.\\n\\nThe process was really frustrating and on top of everything I now have a hard credit pull and nothing to show from it.\\n\\nI feel tricked, as the initial online info was much different, just looking for a way to consolidate debt. I would have been fine if they just gave me this info up front rather than changing info throughout the process.\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nThe representative I had was…AMAZING\\nThe representative I had was personable, kind, and knew her job and executed it well. I\\'m wondering if there is an app to download to make payments\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nThey made the process easy\\nDate of experience: December 15, 2023\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nthanks to you\\nDate of experience: November 21, 2023\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nI could not have been more impressed\\nI could not have been more impressed. I had the money in my checking account within 24 hours of my initial outreach. I had never applied to a personal loan before and did not know what to expect. Would highly recommend.\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nBeen a customer for over 4 years\\nBeen a customer for over 4 years, all payments on time with zero issues.. Went to redo my loan , went thru all the paperwork and time only to be denied for no good reason. suck you in than dont care about you after.\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nLoan\\nIt was one of the best experience and process was so quick and easy. Good job.\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nHorrible company especially the…\\nHorrible company especially the customer service who answer phone you can not get through to anyone who knows what there doing!! Had one person answer and give me a number for Christian’s and Jews when I called wth. Bad company\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nMy interactions were by phone and not pleasant.…\\nMy interactions were by phone and not very timely. The rep didn\\'t seem to me to be experienced in processing my loan request. She also placed me hold several time as she tried to figure out what she was doing wrong. She gave me erroneous information regarding payment plan. She told me i would not have to make a payment in January, however when I began to electronically sign the loan agreement, the paperwork did not reflect what I had been told. I will never apply again for a loan with OneMain by phone\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nOutstanding Service!\\nThe lady, Christina Charles from the Lake Charles, LA branch was excellent in customer service skills, professional, and very patient in guiding me on computer.\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nOneMain Financial - Way to go!\\nOneMain is good for the populace. They have taken me from a skyrocketed bill, to a more reasonable-paying bill, per month. The staff is efficient and friendly. I\\'ll always refer someone to OneMain Financial.\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nDon\\'t Waste Your Time\\nThey are not a good company to do business with. One issue is that they do not report the payments you make as they should. My credit reports show nothing past May 2023. When I disputed this, they updated June & July with \"-\". Here it is 6 months later, and they haven\\'t updated anything. So now, Credit Karma comes up and tells me I missed a payment when I pay early every month. I\\'m tired of disputing them constantly because they can\\'t do their job. On top of that they have super high rates around 25%. The person below who commented on their sales practices was 100% correct in what they said. In my case, I was sent an actual notice from them saying I was pre-approved to refinance my loan to get additional cash out. When I filled out additional information, the soft inquiry said I was approved. It literally gave me 8 or 10 offers to choose from. I selected the best offer for me. When I submitted it, a hard inquiry was done, and then they denied me and made my credit score drop. They are a terrible company. I would never do business with them again. I have managed to raise my score a lot on my own. I literally closed every single credit card I had, except for 2. Despite what financial experts tell you, that worked for me. I can\\'t wait to be done with this place.\\n\\n11/28/2023 - It\\'s funny how in their reply they do not address how they\\'re not reporting my payments or anything regarding their bait and switch sales tactics. I hit the nail on the head. They can\\'t defend their actions.\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nThis is my third loan with One Main Financial. Macy was very detailed and informative.

I went in as asked and was told that Jackson was off that day- there were two womwn there- Mary and Heather- they were very busy but went out of their way to make sure I could be taken care of. They got all of my information and asked if I could come back at 5:15- I did and they were very prompt in helping me. I could not haave asked for better service. The only drawback was that Jackson told me I was approved for 10,000 but I was only allowed 7000. I feel like maybe Jackson needs more training?

My experience working with Naira has been nothing short of excellent, and I believe she truly deserves recognition as a model employee.\\n\\nNaira\\'s positive attitude throughout the entire process was truly refreshing. It made the often stressful experience of securing a loan significantly more manageable. Her prompt responses to my inquiries demonstrated a high level of professionalism and dedication to customer service. No matter the complexity of my questions, Naira consistently provided thorough and clear answers, instilling confidence in every step of the process.\\n\\nOne of the standout qualities that I deeply appreciate about Naira is her patience. There were moments when I needed extra time to understand certain aspects of the loan agreement, and Naira was incredibly patient and understanding. This made me feel valued as a client, and I never felt rushed or pressured to make decisions.\\n\\nFurthermore, Naira\\'s commitment to courtesy and respect was evident throughout our interactions. At no point did she display any hint of rudeness or impatience, even when faced with challenging situations. This level of professionalism and kindness significantly contributed to the overall positive experience I had with your company.\\n\\nIn summary, Naira C has truly exceeded my expectations as a loan consultant. Her exemplary service, positive demeanor, promptness, patience, and respectful approach make her an outstanding asset to your team. I believe recognizing and acknowledging employees like Naira is essential for fostering a culture of excellence within your organization.\\n\\nPlease extend my sincerest gratitude to Naira and consider this as a heartfelt shout-out to her exemplary performance.\\n\\nThank you for maintaining such high standards of customer service.\\n\\nSincerely,\\nEdward A\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nIn the nick of time once more!\\nI was beyond overwhelmed, and felt like My back was against the wall until OneMain emailed letting Me know I possibly could refinance the previous..\\nSuccessful & comfortable is an understatement!\\nThanks again Katirya, You\\'re 1 of the best to do it!\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nLatia set the bar high for the rest of the agent\\nThe original person that was supposed to handle my loan set up a time to call and blew me off.

Coming from an autosalesman who deals with banks daily for a living\\nI have had several dealings with them and have never had anything go smoothly. I am a salesman at a dealership where we have about 20 banks, and sell between 100 to 150 cars a month. Yet we only do about 1 a month through them because they are RIDICOLOUS and ask for everything they can think of.\\n\\nI am talking about birth certificates, socials bill, all bank statements (even though already had paystubs and proof of income wasn\\'t even stated on the main approval!).It seems they want to collect as much unnecessary info as they can on every client they get. Everytime is atleast a 2 day ordeal (latest has taken 3 days), when any other bank takes MINUTES.\\n\\nOnce they get the buyers on the phone, they throw everything they can at them to get more money for things like gap, roadside etc. And will not take a simple no!\\n\\nI have been in the car business for 20 years and have sold thousands of cars and we HAVE NEVER dispised a bank as much as this one.

They were only interested in taking some lower APR loans instead of the high APR ones that i was needing help with.

READ BEFORE:\\nTLDR: Lies, takes advantage, goes against FCRA & CFPB Regulations !\\n\\nI am writing this review to express my extreme disappointment and frustration with my recent experience with One Main Financial. I strongly advise against wasting your time applying for a loan with this company, as they will only lead you on and waste your time without any intention of providing the loan they promise.\\n\\nFrom the very beginning, their representatives gave me false hope and misled me into believing that I was approved for a loan. They assured me that all the information I provided was sufficient for the underwriters and that I would be approved. However, after submitting all the required documents and waiting for two days, I received a call from Carmen, their representative, just before they were about to close. To my shock, she informed me that my loan had been denied, without providing any valid explanation.\\n\\nI repeatedly asked Carmen for the reasons behind the denial, especially since I had been offered a different loan based on the same information I provided to her. However, she failed to provide any satisfactory answers and seemed completely unaware of the current fair credit reporting act regulations. It is disheartening to see that the supervisors at One Main Financial are also not knowledgeable about these regulations, which are meant to protect consumers.\\n\\nWhat is even more upsetting is that they do not seem to care about their customers\\' financial situations, especially during the holiday season. It is distressing to think that lenders like One Main Financial can affect the credit of middle-class individuals through false advertisements and misleading information, all for their own benefit.\\n\\nI even shared with Carmen my recent hardship, which had caused damage to my home. She seemed sympathetic and excited to provide me with a loan, only to deny me after I had gathered all the necessary documentation. It took me three days to understand the issue, and even after explaining that I am an independent contractor with a stable income, they refused to offer me any alternatives or consider a co-signer. They even assured me that my car could be used as collateral, only to later backtrack on that statement.\\n\\nFurthermore, it is unacceptable for a lender to inform a potential customer that their 2022 taxes will not negatively impact their loan approval, only to base their decision solely on those tax returns. It is outrageous that a company with a supposedly reputable reputation would rely on outdated methods of income verification, especially during the Covid pandemic. This practice goes against federal regulations for consumer protection and is incredibly unfair and biased.\\n\\nI am currently working with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and a local professional advocate to hold One Main Financial accountable for their non-compliance with FCRA regulations and the damage they have caused to my already existing hardship. Their actions not only violate regulations but also their own terms and conditions.\\n\\nI urge anyone considering One Main Financial to save themselves the trouble and learn from my experience. It is best to go somewhere else for your financial needs where you will be treated fairly and with respect.\\n\\nHappy to answer any and all questions about my experience as i luckily recorded all the interactions via phone with my financial advisor. Please, learn from me. Do not fall for their fake empathy or deceit. If your businesses suffered during the return from 2022, they will judge and discriminate against you based on that. They will NOT care about your 2023 income. They will only pretend to get you in their system to raise their own inquiry numbers.\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nI didn\\'t know whether I would have been…\\nI didn\\'t know whether I would have been approved for a loan with One Main Financial my credit was not excellent, and I surprise myself that I was approve for a loan.\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nBest loan\\nI has a very helpful person name Jennifer who helped out.

Luego se hacen la vista gorda para darte respuesta sobre tu peticion de prestamo, dicen que te contactarán y lo hacen solamente por unos pocos segundos para decir que te volverán a contactar y no lo hacen, fui personalmente a la oficina ubicada en la San Bruno, CA. el trato de las damas ahí presentes fue muy grosero, con caras de amargadas, poco profesionales con el trato al cliente, después de un rato me dijeron que me iba a llamar una persona, la cual al llamarme me dijo estas palabras “estoy tomando esta llamada la cual no es de mi incumbencia, si quieres seguir el proceso puedo ayudarte pero rápido porque tengo mucho que hacer y esto quita mucho tiempo” le dije bye y colgué la llamada, volví a entrar a la oficina y me dijeron que iban a mandar un email a un manager y que esperara otra llamada en los próximos días, ya cancele mi petición y ellos se quedaron con TODA mi información. Que harán con esa información mía? Sabra Dios. TENGA CUIDADO AL PROPORCIONAR INFORMACIÓN PERSONAL.\\n\\nENGLISH.\\nATTENTION BEWARE! They get all your details, banking information, address, details of your assets, everything! Then they turn a blind eye to give you an answer about your loan request, they say they will contact you and they do it only for a few seconds to say that they will contact you again and they don\\'t, I personally went to the office located in San Bruno, CA. The treatment of the ladies present there was very rude, with bitter faces, unprofessional with customer service, after a while they told me that a person was going to call me, who when calling me said these words \"I am taking this call which is not my concern, if you want to follow the process I can help you but quickly because I have a lot to do and this takes up a lot of time” I said bye and hung up the call, I went back into the office and they told me that they were going to send an email to a manager and to expect another call in the next few days, I already canceled my request and they kept ALL my information. What will they do with that information of mine? God knows.

Been on phone for over an hour trying to cancel 4 ins. 1 exp 2021 home and car ins, we live in OH, its a law to have car ins, we didn\\'t own our home at the time for home ins. We asked for only 1 ins. Now with only 6 payments remaining, yes our fault for not noticing earlier, but their fault for doing this to us. Over $800.00 later, not including the home & car ins. Around last March, don\\'t know why, with good credit, not thinking maybe, no huge car payment like 1st loan, they denied us a $2,000.00 loan. Because I would not hand my paid off car title over to them!! Told us to leave, because I was very, very upset. But now call my phone and my boyfriend\\'s at least 1 a month asking us if we need any extra $$?? That phone call i asked if we both needed to be present to cancel and was told no, by the time it was almost over guess what, he needed to be present, over $5.26 for the Life ins because they took $457.99 and $4.49 Disability because they already have taken the $390.80 that we gave them permission to take out. I don\\'t know, maybe think twice!! I am very, very unhappy and disappointed in One Main!! The $2,000.00 loan, was asked for before I noticed all this insurance nonsense going on!! I have several reviews, also. This is my 1st 1star review!!\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nPeople were all very helpful and…\\nPeople were all very helpful and friendly.\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nQuick and Useful!\\nThe gentleman I was working with, Larry, took great care of my needs and wants, worked with me, followed up with me on action items and was very informative about allll my options.

Thanks Larry!!\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nAwesome\\nGreat people to assist to cover all the bases and very patient helpful\\nThanks much\\n\\nChris J\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nRude entitled branch manager Daniel Solomcha\\nOn Wednesday, November 22nd. I went to OneMain Financial located at 2419 W. Jeffereson St. Joliet IL. 60435. I had previously sent all requested information by email and was told that I was approved for a loan and all I had to do was sign the documents in person to receive my loan.\\n\\nWhen I arrived, a young gentlemen who I cannot recall his name assisted me. I had requested for the $4,500 loan which I was approved for. I asked to do the 4 year payment plan. The young men who was assisting me then stepped outside of the room we were in and Daniel Solomacha walked in and immediately stated that he is the branch manager and that if he does not approve my loan, I would receive no loan. I then asked Daniel, why am I being told this. And Daniel proceeded to say that the only way he would approve for me to receive the loan is if I lower my loan request and get it for the 3 year payment plan and not the 4 year payment plan.\\nI then explained to Daniel that I was very comfortable with my choice and that as an Office Manager who has a solid job, I can afford to make the payments and would like to proceed with my choice of loan and payment plan. Daniel then firmly stated that he would not approve anything if I do not take his choice. Therefore, I was forced to take a lower loan in the amount of $4,000 and the payment plan of 3 years which is what Daniel wanted me to take. I did not want this. I was forced to go with this in order to receive the loan.\\n\\nThis to me is very disturbing and upsetting. My credit score was looked into when I applied for the loan and clearly who ever ran my credit score, was able to see that I have a 100% payment paid on time score. I also have a solid good paying job. Which is why I was qualified. So I do not understand why I was told by the young man who was assisting me at first, that I qualify for $4,500 and that I have the option of doing a 4 year payment plan or a 3 year payment plan, when that clearly was not an option to me. Daniel, the branch manager, took it upon himself to decide how much of a loan I will take and what the extension of the payment plan I would be taking as well.\\n\\nI left the location very unsatisfied and very upset with an awful experience from your branch manager. Needless to say, I will never recommend OneMain Financial to anyone.\\n\\nDaniel Solomacha is an entitled rude individual who will force you to take whatever loan he finds more suitable for to him rather then allow the customer to make their own choice, or else he will not approve you for a loan if you do not take what he is forcing on to you.\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nThe staff\\nThe staff. at this office on sunset are great they explain every.

Once again, thank you to One Main Financial for their assistance.\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nThe worst customer service\\nThe worst customer service. They lie. They’re to busy to help you because they were remodeling the office in New Port Richey and working out of Clearwater. They’re overwhelmed and will let you know that you’re a burden. Let me start with I have good credit and have had three loans with One Main. All paid on time and loans paid off early. I applied and spoke to a Vernisha. She called me and I was approved not for the 20,000 I asked for but for 10,000. After that I couldn’t get her on the phone to help with the process. I called three different times just for her to respond with a text to only ask question on the text. She had no time to help so she put me to the local branch in New Port Richey. That was a Sunday. Monday I heard nothing. Tuesday I called spoke with a Jason and he said I we will have you closed out by tomorrow and you will here from me by the end of the day today or first thing in the morning. No call at all. Wednesday nothing. So I called and left a message at lunch time. Nothing back again. Thursday called and left a message at lunch. Nothing back again. So I decided to go into the local office after work at 5 pm to see what’s going on and if I can help the process since I have already be approved no going on almost two weeks. I spoke to one girl at the desk and told her what was going on and she let me know how over whelmed they are and someone will be with me shortly. Then the branch manager Sean came over and asked me what was going on. I explained it all over again. He seem to be annoyed that I was annoyed with the lack of customer service. he then went to his computer punched a couple keys sat there for five minutes and came back and said I’m sorry we can’t approve you for anything at this time.now if that was the case all of this could of been settled on that first call. But it wasn’t. He was rude and annoyed because I came in without an appointment. I feel he made an executive decision to send me on my way instead of trying to help. Straight BS. Horrible customer service. The company thrives on speed and you can have a 550 credit score and still get approved. BS because my score is way higher than that and I was approved on the first phone call. All other loans were done within 24 to 48 hours. Now I sent an email about the situation and their email response said if I need immediate attention that I need to call them. Again Lack of customer service. Again straight BS.\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nThe lady I dealt with was very pleasant and explained everything to me.\\nThe lady I dealt with was very pleasant\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nNo comments\\nDate of experience: November 08, 2023\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nI enjoyed the customer service that was…\\nI enjoyed the customer service that was provided to as well as their quick follow-up on my unsecured loan.

I accepted the offer and got an approval. I submitted all documents and was contacted with a final approval that had been blessed by underwriting as they had to obtain the value of my collateral. I was given a closing appointment and on the day I was scheduled I called 30 min prior and asked if I could go to the location 20 min from me rather than a branch an hour away and two min before my closing appt I was contacted and told never mind they can’t use my collateral, despite the fact that the website says they accept it as collateral and underwriting approved it. I am a long time customer, have paid off a large loan with OMG and currently have an unsecured credit card with the company. When I complained about being treated this way I was told there was a miscommunication about my appointment time and they are human and allowed to make mistakes. Completely unacceptable. Good payment history and history with this company clearly mean nothing. Why am I being solicited with offers and asked to select my loan terms if they have no intention of following through but more importantly why give a final approval and schedule a closing just to jerk someone around? Be very careful with this discriminating company that scams customers.\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nVery satisfied with the quality service\\nVery satisfied with the quality service.\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nHelped after fire\\nHelped after fire damage electrical $$$$$\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nDetails on points\\nexcellent customer service.. i will recommend this service\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nSmoothly executed\\nSmoothly executed, with rockstar customer service!\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nGreat service\\nThe representative was thorough and transparent.

That\\'s how the entire process felt. I was \"pre-approved\" for two offers...one unsecured, another secured. I selected the unsecured option, knowing that my vehicle is new and little to no equity built-in. I was \"approved\" and had to finish the document process. Minutes later, a gentleman called and directed me that the loan was secured and they were unable to proceed. This was AFTER OMF ran my credit. I understood a credit check was necessary, but had I been informed through the process that my loan would be switched from unsecured to secured, I would not have allowed them to run my credit. Very \"bait and switch\" after all expectations and communication stated unsecured. I was connected with \"customer care\" and was told there\\'s nothing they can do, and \"this just happens\". Incredible.

The only problem is that my wife is in the hospital with a very large blood clot in her abdomen so even though we need the money to help with our monthly bills I can’t even deposit the check so we can use it. We live about 2&1/2 hours from the hospital and barely have enough money for gas not to mention something to eat while I am driving back and forth every day. I wish someone had a solution to my situation because it’s extremely difficult for me to continue going back and forth daily that is 5 hours of highway time every day with the money sitting there in a check that I cannot access without her present yet the doctor said she is going to have to be there for at least another week.

I’ve done business with One Main in the past and I paid off my previous loans years before the due date.\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nhorrendous communication\\nI got an email from OneMain with a “loan offer”, and I decided to pursue it because daycare costs are killing us. I started working with Brittany who was very friendly and helped get our application started. On Wednesday she notified me that we were ready to close and on Thursday we started signing documents. Then the website seemingly glitched and wouldn’t allow my husband to sign his part. So they came back saying they needed identity verification, so we uploaded more documents, answered more questions, etc. All this time Brittany keeps saying “I’ll call you back in the morning”, “I’ll call you back in a little bit”, and hours would pass by with no call or update until I would call and ask. Finally after hours and hours over this week of trying to get this loan to finish closing, I call for an update and am told they decided not to move forward. Brittany didn’t even bother to call and tell me. This has been such a horrible, time consuming, anxiety inducing experience (and in the end all for nothing!) and I would absolutely not recommend using this company.\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nThank you One Main Financial\\nThank you One Main Financial, was very helpful at my time of need.\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nThe people.\\nDate of experience: October 10, 2023\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nI was helped through the whole process…\\nI was helped through the whole process by an attentive employee who show great determination of making my loan possible.\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nIt is faster and more accurate\\nThe process is professional\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nExcellent Friendly Business service\\nService was easy, efficient, friendly and fast.\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nFriendly staff\\nFriendly staff, make you feel right at home!\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nYou guys are awesome!\\nYou guys are awesome!\\nThank you very much!!\\n\\nOneMain Financial\\nVery easy to understand they…\\nThey were very easy to understand they were very professional and they gave me my answer quickly and they gave you my money within hours.

She made me feel so comfortable with the over the phone process. She was so patient and very kind. I felt like I was talking to a real friend. I will always come to OneMain Financial for all my needs because of your quick turnaround and mostly because I was helped by Tammy. I will continue to use the Palatka office from now on.

I called them and the rep that answered the line had no knowledge of any reply they had sent to me and went further on to say to just disregard the response, because they don't really intend for people to act on the responses when they reply to reviews left by customers, they just reply so it looks good for the company. I asked for a supervisor and of course, none was available. Again, I say this company is a SCAM. They have a lot of hidden and made up fees and never acknowledge their mistakes. They are lairs and I would not encourage anyone to do business with them.
