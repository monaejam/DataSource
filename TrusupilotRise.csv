","2023-12-27T20:53:10.000Z","I had been paying on time, then due to my local bank closing, I had to change banking accounts. Rise made it very difficult for me to update this information online so I resorted using my debit card to make payments online instead of checking account information. Long story short, they flagged my debit card as fraudulent and I was unable to make any more online payments. They will only receive cashiers checks as a single parent working full-time it’s hard to make it to the bank during banking hours to get these checks. Every time I get a different story one lady one as far as to letting me send her my new checking information via email and told me it would be updated so I could continue to make payments online. This never happened now now I can’t even access my online account to see how many payments I have left.

So me and my roommate elect to apply for a loan we both get approved for up to 5,000. So we choose what we want and it shows the amount we pay and the interest and the payments. So except the terms and sign the loan agreement and think we are getting funds in the next 24 hours like it says. Nope no funds I get an email later that day that we both need to send in information to verfiy my ID, SS card and recent bank statement. We both send the required info I call back they got both of our information and good to go. They said need to sign back in and except the terms and the loan again and sign we do that then told get the funds in another 24 hours. Okay at this point I am like okay wow this as gone on for 2 days now back and forth. I have been told I was approved and get my funds and haven’t. I check my email today and we both got an email saying we were denied. I am like what denied for what we were told we were approved it says this reason for denial “unable to verify application information based on documents provided”. So at that point I’m frustrated and upset feel lied to and betrayed I call back and ask for a better clarification they can’t give me one they said it’s automatic generated response I am like give me a number don’t have one. Wow and no one there a supervisor no one can assist. They tell me all you can do is wait the 10 days and apply again wow I’m thinking and this is a company. They should be taking to court on this and sued. They even hit me with a hard inquiry and it says will run credit for a hard inquiry once signed and approved well I was WTH!!!!! I guess the next time should be cautious with who I try to do business with.","1","I don’t know what to believe anymore with Rise???","https://trustpilot.com/reviews/65c5614e5e80cc0e9d8ef6a1"

"RISEcredit.com","true","Enrique, we regret to hear of your dissatisfaction. The loan is designed to provide you with funds at the best possible price and only if other forms of credit are not available or are more expensive. We review the cost of the loan in great detail in the loan agreement before the option to accept the loan is presented. We also offer a five full business day rescind guarantee in case you decide that the loan isn’t right for you. You can make extra payments and/or payments above the minimum amount at any time without any pre-payment penalties. And if you pay off your loan early, you will only pay interest and/or fees for the amount of time that your loan has been active. If there are additional questions or concerns, please email us rise_spokesperson@risecredit.com.

But I'm awake now-the interest rate Rise charges is stratospheric; I refi'd an $1100 loan 2/23, faithfully pay $210/month yet Rise says I won't be PIF until 4/25! That means I will have paid $5,460 for an $1100 loan.

","2023-08-25T00:50:47.000Z","I NEVER thought getting a loan would be so EASY! I went to a typical financial institution to ask for a loan and there was so much red tape involved, you not only had to fill out a lot of paper work, you had to have collateral, and get insurance placed on yourself and the collateral and that added cost is also ADDED to your loan amount, which adds 1000's of dollars to your loan, on top of that you STILL have to pay interest on the entire amount! For example, you may get a check for $6999, the insurance on you and your collateral may cost another $10,000 bringing your loan to around 17k, add interest and you are paying back 35k, when you only received a check for $6999. Do the math you pay back 5 times what you actually took home! With Rise the loan was fast and easy! The money was in the bank the next day and the payment plan is simple to follow. The loan can even be paid off early, saving you money!

","2023-08-30T21:09:15.000Z","Stay away!!!! Interest rates are way too high. I have used Rise for years and this year was the straw that broke the camel's back. When applying for a loan, I always select the $2,250 loan with a payment schedule of 20 payments. This current loan I selected to do the same payment schedule. Fast forward a couple of months, I noticed my balance never went down only kept rising. Generally after a few payments, I would see a dollar or two come off of the balance, but this time I've only seen significant increases. I went to look at my contract and somehow my payback schedule was changed from 20 payments to 44 payments. I immediately called Rise Credit customer service to see if there was a glitch in the system because I would never select to make roughly the same payments I've made in a previous loan agreement for a longer term. So, now this new loan agreement is saying if I make all 44 payments will have paid back $8,430.79 for a $2250.00 loan. A total of $10680.78

Here is the breakdown from the last three loans I have gotten through rise:

1. (2023 44 weeks) $2250 270.85% $242.72 biweekly

(8/30/2023 Edit: I received an email from Rise Credit corporate office stating that the rates and terms for a $2250 loan have changed from a maximum of 26 biweekly payments to a maximum of 44 biweekly payments. You no longer have the option to choose 20 or 26 payments. So, if you decide to go through with the loan for those 44 biweekly payments, you will have paid back $10,680.79 for a $2250 loan. The rates and terms on the ""What it costs"" tab are inaccurate.

2. (2022 20 weeks) $2250 272.95% $262.20 biweekly

3. (2021 20 weeks) $2250 277.97% $277.97 biweekly

I am trying to figure out why in the world would I select to make more payments for roughly the same amount of money I was repaying in previous loans. I kept telling the representatives I spoke with that I would not select that. Also, if I selected to make 44 payments instead of 20 payments like I always do, wouldn't my payments be less?

Something is not right and I know it. I have been trying to get the corporate office on the phone, but no one will return my calls. I need answers.

Whatever you do, find another way because this company is scamming people.

Please, please, please pay close attention to every click you make. Screenshot every step, especially the rates and payback schedule you select. Go back and check to make sure your clicks were correctly recorded. Also, making extra payments towards your loan does not go towards your principal balance. You will be making extra payments for nothing. Either pay off as fast as you can or make regularly scheduled payments.

Most importantly FIND ANOTHER SOURCE TO GET MONEY FROM.","1","Stay away!!!","https://trustpilot.com/reviews/64e7b8a78bb9c65adf5c9aa5"

","2022-10-01T00:58:48.000Z","Unfortunately I had a bad experience with Rise. In 2019 I was working with a debt consolidation company and the settlement reached for Rise was $2546.34 and I paid $1940.00 leaving $606.34 left to pay.

I was physically injured in 2018 and 2019 and couldn’t work but didn’t want to lose the settlement.

The debt consolidation company refused to work with me on the last couple payments that I owed on my Rise settlement and instead canceled the settlement while charging me fees plus the $1940 I paid to Rise came to $3400 total and then the debt company and Rise wanted another $2500.

Now it’s 2022 and I just got off the phone with Rise and offered to pay the $606.34 in full that was left on the settlement but they now want $1500.

I can’t pay it.

So I paid all of that money for nothing and it’s ruined my credit.

If you have another option other than Rise I would take it.

I plan on filing complaints with the FTC and the Consumer Financial Protection Agency.","1","Unfortunately I had a bad experience…","https://trustpilot.com/reviews/633774a83d107cfdfccfc253"

While I did not receive the requested amount, they did consider me for a smaller loan (not very far off from my original request). I was very pleased that I did not receive just a denial, they actually took the time to consider my situation and made an offer that they hoped would assist me.

I appreciate this type of business and am extremely satisfied with the terms and conditions of this loan. If you are looking for fast approval, fast funding and efficient service, choose RISE credit.

It is true that the interest rate is less than desirable, however, one always has to assume this burden when seeking fast funds and a lower credit score. Simply read the terms and I'm sure you will agree that they offer good solutions to money issues.","5","Excellent service!","https://trustpilot.com/reviews/62ffb288142fce1f45fef78b"

Their level of customer service when communicating is awful! You can send and communicate very clear requests & instructions over and over, yet they will drag out email chains acting like they don’t understand what your requesting until things drag out past 5pm, then they say they are unable to honor the request. This also occurs when you finally are able to get a customer service rep on the phone as well.

This continues to happen over the same request for months now, which is ridiculous. Who is managing & training @ Rise or even cares enough at Rise to actually follow thru with anything other than their own agenda?
Not one person has corrected the request even now, which causes more frustration and headache than needed.

","2022-05-23T23:30:30.000Z","A zero rating would be more appropriate. Borrower BEWARE! I’ve been trying to pay this loan off for over a month now. My bank sent them a check on 4/22 and it was never received. I spoke to Rise customer service and was told checks are credited to accounts same day received. So, My bank sent another overnight to them on 5/17 with tracking and signature required. It was received 5/18 and signed for by an employee. Several calls since then and given multiple varying answers. Once it wasn’t received. Next it was noted as received on my account and would post by 5pm that day (it did not), then they would contact me within 24 hours and it would be “escalated” — no call. I called them with my bank on three-way, and was informed it had not been received and they couldn’t verify if the person who signed had it or not…and that it would take 7-10 days from receipt to post…tons of excuses and lies! When the original check was mailed it would’ve paid this loan off. Now I have accrued over $400 in interest atop the original amount thanks to their daily interest charges. Wish I’d NEVER hit the accept button on this “loan” and I HIGHLY advise you to avoid them at all cost! I’ve paid my loan every month, on-time, and never an issue until I want to pay it off to better myself and get out from under some debt. This company is nothing more than a payday loan service at best. Complete and total loan sharks with horrible customer service and extremely questionable business practices. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere. There are better alternatives.

3. Excessive credit obligations
Are you kidding me? My credit report hasn't got ONE SINGLE derogatory item on it. Excessive changes in personal information?

Your RISEcredit.com Team","2022-03-21T19:41:04.000Z","Full disclosure, I've been a Rise customer since 2016 and have taken and repaid 8 loans. For the most part, the experience has been great. The application process is easy, they work with you when you experience hardship, they take debit card payments which is oddly uncommon. I used to highly recommend them. Until today.

I applied for a loan on Thursday 3/17. As a returning customer, the process was super easy. Just confirmed nothing had changed, hit submit, and was approved. I signed the loan agreement and they said the funds would be in my account the next day. The next day, the money isn't in my account. I log on and it shows my loan is in the funding status. Ok, maybe they sent it that day and it would be in my account the next business day. Sunday I received an email reminding me that my first payment would be due on Friday 3/25. Today, not only was the money not in my account, but I received a request for more information. I sent the information right away, and almost immediately received an email saying my loan was declined. I'm researching whether this is illegal, but is unquestionably immoral and shameful from a customer service standpoint. I will never borrow from Rise again and can no longer recommend that anyone else do either.","1","Never again","https://trustpilot.com/reviews/6238d4d0ab0a5e0f747f60f9"

The loan is designed to provide you with funds at the best possible price and only if other forms of credit are not available or are more expensive. We review the cost of the loan in great detail in the loan agreement before the option to accept the loan is presented. We also offer a five full business day rescind guarantee in case you decide that the loan isn’t right for you. You can make extra payments and/or payments above the minimum amount at any time without any pre-payment penalties. And if you pay off your loan early, you will only pay interest and/or fees for the amount of time that your loan has been active. If there are additional questions or concerns, please email us rise_spokesperson@risecredit.com.

Your RISEcredit.com Team","2022-02-17T15:33:10.000Z","At first I thought I found a decent company. The plan was to be able to repay the loan fast. However, my situation changed and my hope for a quick payoff disappeared. The payment from this company is far higher than any other similar loan companies I have used in the past. This is why I hoped to pay the loan off fast. Then when I hit a rough spot and fell behind in payments I attempted to work with RISE. They did offer a 3 payment plan to bring my account current. However, they locked my online account. So instead of allowing me the fastest possible way to make my payments, RISE made it incredibly difficult to make my payment plan payments. I tried to chat with customer service but they are useless. RISE even blocks their own customer service people from helping customers trying to make things right. All customer service does is give you a phone number to call. I found that to be a waste of time as well. Nor do I have time during the day to make phone calls and hang on the line forever! I was also told that after making 2 payments RISE would make 1 payment as part of the agreement to catch up my account. I was able to see my payment history, and to no surprise to me, one of my payments was missing in the payment history. What did RISE do with my payment? Did they hide my payment so they could claim I didn't make it and not make the single payment promised to me? All I can say is if you are thinking about using this company for a loan, I would recommend trying some other company. I have found RISE uncooperative and unresponsive when trying to contact them. Also very unhelpful when you want to work with them. I have filed several complaints with the company with no meaningful response what so ever!! I hope this makes it to the top of the review list because you should be very cautious about using this company!","1","At first I thought I found a decent…","https://trustpilot.com/reviews/620e6ab6bc5a51af69c58271"

The loan is designed to provide you with funds at the best possible price and only if other forms of credit are not available or are more expensive. We review the cost of the loan in great detail in the loan agreement before the option to accept the loan is presented. We also offer a five full business day rescind guarantee in case you decide that the loan isn’t right for you. You can make extra payments and/or payments above the minimum amount at any time without any pre-payment penalties. And if you pay off your loan early, you will only pay interest and/or fees for the amount of time that your loan has been active. If there are additional questions or concerns, please email us rise_spokesperson@risecredit.com.

Once I finally logged-on it to change my AutoPay options it stated that I needed to call customer support to do that. No other financial institution does that! So I have to wait the following day to get ahold of a rep to change it. So, I'm taking their word for it. No confirmation. Then I asked if they could reimburse me for the $161.45 they took out of my account and 2 days later received an email DENIED. They are predatory lender!!

I completed the online process and recieved a email notification that they needed to complete a bank verification. No problem right? Not with this company . I go to login in on their site ( I wrote down my credentials) and it would not work so I utilized the lost password feature . It did not send me a code nor a email link to reset . I tried both mobile and desk top . Used the auto chat feature and that was zero help . Emailed the helpdesk and they insisted i had forgotten my own bank login?? LOL If they would have read my email they would have comprehended that I was trying to access THEIR site . ZERO customer service , zero care . If they are this absent minded with a brand new app... do I really trust them with my personal financial info ?? No . And now I am reading BBB reports . I am staying away .

","2021-08-19T16:35:09.000Z","This is the first time I heard of RiseCredit through CreditKarma and I will be honest, I was kind of skeptical and unsure on whether I should or not do a loan with them. But, after reading a few reviews and seeing how happy people were with their services I decided on giving them a try. The process went smoother than I expected. I did everything online. They reviewed everything within a day or so and before the weekend was over from when I applied on a Friday I had the funds in my account come Monday morning. I am very pleased with how fast the process went and how fast I got the funds. Granted, the APR% is very high, but I don't plan on paying the loan for that long, my goal is to try and pay it off earlier. Other than the APR%, I will most likely use them again if I ever needed to.","4","Unsure and Skeptical :)","https://trustpilot.com/reviews/611e883d6e38167b798b169b"

"RISEcredit.com","true","Robert, we regret to hear of your dissatisfaction. The loan is designed to provide you with funds at the best possible price and only if other forms of credit are not available or are more expensive. We review the cost of the loan in great detail in the loan agreement before the option to accept the loan is presented. We also offer a five full business day rescind guarantee in case you decide that the loan isn’t right for you. You can make extra payments and/or payments above the minimum amount at any time without any pre-payment penalties. And if you pay off your loan early, you will only pay interest and/or fees for the amount of time that your loan has been active.

Not only did I not receive empathy or concern, but I was also told if the money is not returned I will be responsible for paying it back. I am still shocked the website does not have a pop where you enter an account number that warns applicants about the risk and consequences of a typo. Although I don't think it was a typo because I entered it twice and double-checked.

In another day or two I will have a walk-in shower to facilitate my handicapped status. I appreciate RISEcredit giving me a chance to improve my quality of life. I pay ALL my bills on time everytime. What affected my credit rating was the plethora of hard inquiries accumulated while i was looking for a loan that i could afford (99% is high but it's commensurate with risk and i understand that. High risk, high reward.) However, it pales in comparison to 150% to 450%. Yes, bunky, there are 450% loans out there. You can look at the glass as being half empty and cry in your beer about the high interest rate or you can look at the glass as being half full and be thankful that there was a loan company willing to help out when you needed it most!

Not recommended unless absolutely necessary, but they do grant loans where others don't.

I updated after I spoke with Rise per their reply on my previous review, and they simply advised that the terms are as they are and nothing can or will be changed. This wasn't unexpected, but the person I spoke with was professional and understanding at least.

I am looking to pay off this loan shortly and after already paying close to $5,000 I will still have to pay over $3,000 to pay it off. This is a an extremely expensive option.

RISE Credit","2020-09-03T04:09:53.000Z","I’m so sick of Rise Credit! I took out a loan back in dec of 2019 with an insane interest rate around 218%! I tried canceling initially right after I accepted since there’s a 5 day grace period, but they wouldn’t cancel. I called to find out what was going on and they claimed they never received the email to cancel and it was too late. At that point, hundreds in interest had already accrued. They eventually came back saying the found the email which was annoying.

Fast forward to this year, my hours were cut like a lot of people so I had to extended the payment date a few times which didn’t help me at all because the balance jumped up to an unmanageable amount.

Since I wasn’t late on the loan, they wouldn’t work out a settlement with me and the balance kept going up and up. They finally decided to work out a settlement (still not a reasonable offer they gave) and I ended up agreeing just because I wanted it to be over with. I paid the settlement in full on the day agreed, and they took forever to update the account. The loan still kept accruing interest after the settlement payment was made and they wouldn’t update anything.

They finally updated it but a few days after they did, they reported me as 30-60 days late to the credit bureaus!!!!!!!!!! The reason I had such an issue getting them to offer a settlement was because I WASNT late or past due from what they kept telling me! So how do they report me as late after we agreed to settle on a specific date and the payment was made when we agreed!?!?!?!?! They told me multiple times I couldn’t pay before the settlement date after we generated the paperwork because any payment I made at that point would not go towards the settlement.

They are frauds and they just want to scam people out of their money. I’ve already grossly overpaid them if I add up all of the monthly payments I made along with the settlement, now they’re trying to report me as late and they increased the balance due to a crazy amount because they continued to accrue interest after we had agreed to a settlement amount AND after I made the payment!

They have no compassion on anyone during this time. The company is simply worried about money and that’s it. If I’m not working like I was before all of this started and I’m struggling to survive, how can you expect customers to be able to make payments with such high interest rates?? To not even lower the payment amount it interest rates during this time is disgusting! The money I wasted paying this billion dollar company interest could really help during these difficult times.

I just don’t understand how the interest rates offered are even legal. They actually aren’t in CA anymore and Rise won’t don’t anything to help out.

This company is sick and please don’t wast your time with these types of places!!!!!

I’m currently looking into starting a class action suit in CA!","1","I’m so sick of Rise Credit","https://trustpilot.com/reviews/5f5069b902e85708c8deacd6"

There was no warning whatsoever so this took me completely by surprise (October 2019). I immediately reached out to RISE to inform them of my sudden change in income and I would need a different payment arrangement. I made all my payments on time and in full and was in good standing so I thought they’d show some empathy. Maybe say ""Sure, let’s see how we can help!"" But they would not work with me on my payments for the final 3 months I had left. I'll never take out a loan with them again. The customer service rep was not friendly and just didn't care.

I finally got around to making a payment. After I made the payment, they sold my account to collections. I'll never be a customer of theirs again.

Update to their reply:
You showed no empathy to a loyal customer who always paid on time. Your reply is generic and unhelpful. It’s all about money and NOT your customers. I continue to be disappointed by customer service.","1","I'll Never Be A Customer Again!!","https://trustpilot.com/reviews/5eb5b5f125e5d20a88906d9f"

Get thousands of dollars fast at very high APR (about 135%) and plan to pay early - no pre-payment fees, nice! Sounds okay, better than asking family for a loan for a few months, right? Okay in good economic times, but now the Federal Natural Disaster has been declared, and it's clear many RISE customers need a different payment plan.

Was in a tough spot and needed money in advance. Took no time to get the money in my bank account.
I was able to then pay it off a few weeks later and not pay too much in interest. Even if I had to use it longer term, the payments were very manageable.
It may be one of the clearest loans I've done. You have all your payments listed and shows the interest you are paying as it builds up so there is no surprises. They are easy to contact and don't just seem like some automated machine.

Before paying the loan off, I spoke with a representative and asked if I paid out would I be able to reopen the loan. She advised that once I paid out I just had to wait 24 hours to apply again. I did exactly what she asked and was declined. I called back to ask why I was declined and the second rep I spoke with advised me that the application I filled out was for a ""refinance"" and the system did that in error. She advised to just wait until the next day and the system would allow me to apply for an actual loan again. Of course the next day the system did NOT allow me to apply again. I then called back and spoke with a 3rd rep who advised me that I was declined because of my ""credit score"" and i needed to wait 45 days to apply again. He also advised that I should of just refinanced the loan instead of paying it out, an option i was never offered in the beginning.

I thought I had an emergency expense I needed to pay for, but luckily I ended up no longer needing the money. I emailed Rise on 22nd requesting to cancel the loan because it says on THEIR website that’s you have 5 business days to cancel.

I didn’t receive a response so I called them on Monday late afternoon to verify they had canceled the loan and would rake the money back out of my account. I was told that somehow they never received my message even though I logged into my rise account and contacted them through their site. I received the confirmation message saying someone would respond, but they insist they didn’t receive it.

I told the lady I was speaking with that I’m 10000% positive it said my message went through, and regardless I would still like to cancel because Monday would be the 5th business day so I was still within the 5 day period even if they wanted to lie and say my message wasn’t received.

I was told that yes, it was the 5th business day, but that I missed the cut off tome to cancel!!!! No where on their website does it say there’s a time I have to call to cancel. I could understand if the place was closed, but clearly they weren’t seeing as how I was speaking to someone!! I’m so frustrated because now they are saying I owe $144 dollars in interest for a loan that I didn’t even use and tried to cancel within their grace period.

How in the world do I already owe $144 dollars in interest in 1 weeks time! That’s disgusting and they should be ashamed of themselves. They clearly lied saying they never received the message in order to keep me from canceling the loan just so they could rip me off and take my money.

They also are trying to get around the new California law that was passed and is supposed to be effective 1/1/20 that prevents loan companies from charging more than 36% in interest.

This company isn’t ethical and they will lie to rip you off. Please go anywhere else but here, it’s absolutely not worth it!!","1","PLEASE DON’T USE RISE!!","https://trustpilot.com/reviews/5e045d12c84545083435cf47"
"RISEcredit.com","false","Good Afternoon Daniel,
We’re sorry to hear of your dissatisfaction with your RISE Credit loan.

RISE fully discloses all interest and fees associated with your RISE Credit loan prior to signing the loan agreement. We also provide a five-business day rescission policy in the event that you decide RISE is not for you. We also advise you to pay your loan in full as quickly as possible to save on the interest. Please contact us at (866) 580-1226 or rise_spokesperson@risecredit.com if you have any further questions or if you need assistance.
Thank you,
RISE Credit
","2019-12-23T21:31:15.000Z","This for anyone new. The money is great to loan but be careful they do not have several things in contract that will make you take longer than expected to pay loan off. Example 2500k loan will cost you 9000k. How is this when borrowing they add interest already but charge daily interest as well depending on the state. My payment plan they will get there interest first and only after the first year.so if you pay 225 every two weeks they add 16.44 every day which equals 115 each week before you even make the first payment. As they responded to you review you will see how they advised me before hand and try to make it sound as if they did please note I'm not unhappy I decided to take the offer but they will respond like this. Dont sit there and respond to something I spoke the truth on. Also the customer service spoke with me and advised me that it was not in the contract but the additional interest is was the lender adds to you depending on the loan you applied for. Again nothing wrong with the loan but when you borrow be careful.","3","This for anyone new","https://trustpilot.com/reviews/5e01278bc84545083434b6f8"

","2019-08-21T23:10:10.000Z","Before applying I read the reviews and thought this would be a great experience. This is the second time I applied after pre approval. I turned in all documents both times and got declined for a reason my bank can’t be verified. I sent the required bank statement. I was told I had a negative balance. I did not have a negative balance per my visit to my branch and my account was in good standing. So I don’t understand.

I am very saddened to experience this up hill battle twice. My opinion, this experience tells me a lot about a company. If you need help you won’t get it here.

I hope no one else has to experience this communication failure.

Got what I needed and was saved from losing my apartment after getting hit with dental surgery that wasn't optional. Had enough left over to get my credit cards back below 30% AND pay off of a small loan I had. Maxed cards out paying bills beforehand and it wrecked my credit to below 600. Credit score will be over 700 soon. Never seen such flexible payments. I get paid bi-weekly, so my paydays are always odd dates. I was able to select that as a payment option. Payments come out the day I get my check, so I can't screw this up. Wow! So impressive! Wish I never dealt with another loan company. I wish my other large loan was with Rise. Will use Rise again and recommend to friends/family. So thankful for this company!!!

","2019-07-18T20:46:17.000Z","I had a great experience with my first RISE loan and was able to pay it back early, within 2 months of accepting the loan. The process was effortless. I received an invitation in the mail, entered my offer code and info and had the funds the next morning.

Unfortunately, my experience in trying to get another loan has been beyond frustrating. I'm left with the feeling that RISE doesn't really want me as a customer or my 150% interest.

The first attempt resulted in my application being closed promptly after providing verification documents with no real explanation why.

The second attempt (started July 9th) resulted in a ""48-business-hour"" review process that turned into 9 days. I called RISE support earlier this week and the rep ignored my questions as to why the process was taking much longer than expected. (I felt like I was talking to a recording.)

Finally yesterday I was advised to log in to the system and review the result of the Review. I was unable to actually access the page the email directed me to view; I was sent instead to complete another application. Confused, I called support yet again and was instructed that I was approved and just needed to fill out the forms again. So I did. Which then resulted in a duplicate loan in the system and re-opening the original loan from July 9th.

Then, I get another email advising me to provide the same documentation (ID, SS card, proof of income) I had already provided before and wait another supposed 48 business hours.

Don't bother emailing support, either. Email support is just as bad as phone support. What does that leave? Not doing business with RISE, I suppose.

Lesson learned: Approved does not actually mean approved, even if a support rep explicitly uses the phrase ""you're approved"".","1","Approved... or not? Frustratingly Unhelpful Customer Service","https://trustpilot.com/reviews/5d30da99ccd70b09545c1efd"

They were very prompt, streamlined the whole process, was able to get everything done in a reasonable amount of time. They claimed to reward returning customers, with offers like better tdd rates and terms. NOT ACCURATE AT ALL. Not only was I not given ANY better rate or term, RISE apparently now has an issue with my bank and after initially approving, waited until the end of the business day to revoke that approval. And, as far as I can tell, the statements about reporting to credit bureaus is false as well, nothing from them on either of the 3. But I bet if I'd defaulted on my loan or been late they'd make sure to report that.
