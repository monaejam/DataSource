Having bad credit is a struggle and ur stuck with 30% rates which Is very high and punished the poor. I am way more fruggle and didn’t want s loan aber the rates were sö good i knew consolidated is what I needed! Please be thankful for the simplicity of a single payment with many options on how to pay. Paying towards principal every month along with payment is very smart also. I hope this helps!",

Christmas, birthday vacations , random emergencies could be handled and slowly paid off.\nThe divorce was brutal leaving me, among other things, in financial ruin. It’s been over 5 years and I have built a nice life for me and my kids. The only thing that still plagued me was my credit. Credit that my ex destroyed. (I know, I know. Poor me)\n\nI’m in a better situation now with a good job. I pay my bills, taxes, etc. yet no company would give me a chance to prove I can be trusted again with a line of credit.\nHolidays, bdays became much more..limited. Vacations were non existent. And random emergencies were simply not allowed!\n\nAVANT is giving me the chance to feel more secure in life. Much more able to truly enjoy the small things that are often overlooked when money is a constant worry.",

  "reviewDescription": "TL;DR: Questionable applications opened & poor customer service. Transparency is the issue.\n\n\nI was offered a 2% rewards card if I applied and opened a new account with Avant through Credit Karma. I did as told. I discovered that two applications were opened when I applied in February 2024.\n\nThis concerned me; so,I emailed Avant support asking if the card I was approved for was still a rewards card. (I hadn’t received anything in the mail yet.) I was told to call. I did. I was told that it was in fact the rewards card. I also was told via email that I would receive a separate email verifying the rewards portion. I never did. I tried emailing again and received another ‘call support’ response. So I did. Then the system was down; no help again.\n\nI decided to make an approximate $15 purchase to see if any rewards would generate. Nothing. I called again today (05March2024) and was told that it wasn’t a rewards card and that I can’t have two cards. I tried to explain that I only applied for the one. I was given a scripted response. I asked for a supervisor. I was told one wasn’t available and to request a callback when one was. I then closed my account.\n\nI will not work with a company that cannot provide a straight answer; especially when it appears that two applications were opened at once without my consent. If you never have to ask for support, this card will be ideal.\n\nPlease improve communication.",

  "reviewDescription": "Massive bait and switch. Received approval that showed $0 under origination fees and $10,000 as total amount to be deposited in my bank. Then before funding changed fine print that doesn't display well on mobile devices. Changing terms to 10% origination fee or $999 and only depositing $9001 into account. This dramatically changed the terms to a loan that was a very very very bad deal and I never would have accepted. People like this should be thrown into prison? I didnt catch until 24 hours after they funded because they funded to the WRONG CHECKING ACCOUNT. Even after confirming through 2 diferent agents on two different calls that is was going to the correct account.",

The only downside that I found (for me) was the amount I was approved for was not the amount I actually received. They take out fees first. I wish they would just add it at the end. I had calculated exactly what I needed but once they took the fees out I had to come up with a different plan.",

I thought the new amount would be deducted the same day that it has been deducted for the previous six months. I went to store and looked like a total fool when my account was 480 dollars in the hole. I looked and seen Avant had moved my due date to the 20th and pulled the money two days earlier. When I called Avant the lady rudely informed me that the due date last month was the 20th and the 20th of this month. Zero Empathy. She ewas an ass and said it would be on the new agreement. I went back through my emails and Avant on December 19th, 2023 sent me an email outlining everything.\nThe current balance, the additional funds, the admin fee, the new total, and the funding date. Nothing about a new due date. I am a simple person, I wish that if you were going to make changes to my automatic payment it would have been pre-approved and not done without my knowledge. Also why would you change the due date that had been previously set for half a year before. Frustrated to be in the hole for two days before payday! I know Avant doesn't give a care, pass on the blame to me, even though I have been making this payment on the 22nd for six prior months. You don't care because you aren't having to not feed your family for two days. Just pissed about this situation",

After a year or so of payments they usually have an offer to refinance your loan at a lower interest rate, my first loan was 27% and once refinance it was 19%. It's a good option to consolidate debt I think, sure it's expensive but for some people it's better than watching their credit card interest bleed them to death over the years like mine was. I would recommend this company to anymore who needs a loan.",

I then made another $100.00 payment (online) and called customer (lousy) service. As soon as someone picked up the phone the first thing I heard was my MIRANDA RIGHTS that this is attempt to collect a debt...(wait - what debt?) tolld them I had made the payment on 1/10 and another one on 2/14. They said the payment on 1/10 went to my balance and they have no record of the 2/14 payment (yet) though my back said it was already pending. explained the problem and said there is nothing they could do about the 1/10 payment because it had been made (24 HRS) to soon...WAIT WHAT?. and the the late charge will stand and that there is nothing they could do about it. Asked to talk to a supervisor, only to placed on hold for over 25 min and nothing. I have emailed them multiple times and after 2 days nothing. Told to cancel the card and would just pay if off, but that I would NOT pay either the late charge nor the annual fee since the card would not be used in the coming year. If you have a problem with them, customer service is NO help at all and emailing them is just as bad.\n\n\nSupplement....\nAfter nearly 3 weeks...Avant finally responded, all it is - is a canned response, no thoughts and still they want you to reach out to them...like I have multiple times already, and all I get is just lip service and no action. Hey AVANT...here's an idea...get off you computer and act like a human and maybe, I don't know...maybe call the customer. you sure expect the customer to do it and do your job.",

I received a hard inquiry and my score dropped five points.\n\n\nAvant’s reply states a soft inquiry won’t affect my score. Sure.\n\nBut I got a hard inquiry because you denied my application because I refused to give a third party my bank account sign in information.\n\nThat was never listed as a requirement.\nI would never in this day and age provide my online banking access to a credit card company or any company.\n\nThis is completely unacceptable business practices, Avant is predatory and dishonest. I should have trusted the negative reviews.\n\nEven Avant’s reply is deceptive.\nI received a hard inquiry.\nYet notice their reply starts off with a completely useless fact that doesn’t apply to this situation, obviously in an attempt to negate my factual experience.\n\nI just double checked, and there is a hard inquiry… Please contact credit bureau and remove the inquiry Avant.\n\n\n",

Please be advised that a soft credit inquiry will not affect your credit score and is not visible to other creditors. However, upon submission of your application for final review, each customer is required to acknowledge and consent to a hard credit inquiry. Note that rates are determined on an individual basis and are based on a number of factors including your credit score and repayment history, among others.

I told them that the \"Plaid\" would not work, they told me to submit a voided check....which I did. I got an email the next day to say that I needed to sinc my bank account and the next day another one. I called to check in on this and they told me they have everything and that they would send me approval or denial in 2-3 business days. On the 7th business day I got and email that said that my account was now expired. I called to ask them about it and they said that my loan inquiry was closed and to apply again. I told them you told me you already had anything. The lady thanked me and then told me to apply again. I ask is it worth my time if I can not link my bank account. At that time, she told me that step is optional and that I would need to apply again.... I am not happy with how this was handled and I am now not sure if I should apply again or just give up!",

When filling out the account information, I put down my permanent address. I was expecting to be able to add a different PO Box mailing address later on, as I live in a town that only uses PO Boxes and does not offer street deliveries for mail.\n\nI sent an email to ask for my mailing address to be updated. I was told this is against the policy they have for addresses (PO Boxes are not allowed to be set as an address on your account).\n\nI sent another email explaining I just wanted to update my mailing address, not my physical address. I was told to call in to speak with someone.\n\nI called in and was told having the credit card mailed to my PO Box is not possible. I asked to speak to a manager at least three times; I was ignored and was told repeatedly what I wanted was not possible. I finally gave up and told them to close my account. They proceeded to close my account, and I asked again to speak to a manager. After an almost 10-minute hold, I am informed the manager is \"on a call\" and they can leave a message. I had my account with this company for a grand total of one day! Not worth the headache.",

  "reviewDescription": "I recently applied for the AvantCard, hoping to build my credit. However, the experience turned into a nightmare from the very beginning. After receiving the card, I attempted to activate it, but it wouldn't work. Despite multiple attempts through the online portal and calls to customer service, the issue remained unresolved.\n\nCustomer service was unhelpful and unresponsive. After waiting on hold for extended periods, I finally reached a representative who failed to activate the card and couldn't explain the problem. Frustrated and unable to use the card, I decided to cancel it.\n\nTo my shock and dismay, the representative informed me that I was still responsible for the annual fee, even though the card never worked. They refused to waive the fee or offer any form of compensation for the inconvenience and time wasted.\n\nWhen I requested to speak to a manager, I was astonishingly told that they didn't have one available. This lack of accountability and escalation options further highlighted the company's unprofessionalism and disregard for customer concerns.\n\nAvoid AvantCard at all costs! Their non-functional card, poor customer service, hidden fees, and lack of accountability make them a terrible choice for anyone seeking a credit card. Be wary of their misleading offers and save yourself the frustration and financial hassle I experienced.",

  "reviewDescription": "It takes up to 10 days for anything to post to your account. You cannot see any transactions for a month. So good luck catching fraud. I called to check my balance before I made a transaction and it's not accurate. I called to see why my account was showing negative and no one could tell me any transactions or see anything on my account to even help me. The first representative told me they don't post the over balance to the credit bureau and that it wasn't going to hurt my credit. Same morning they reported to the credit bureau and I lost a ton of points. I called back to see what happened and they still can't see anything on my account. I asked them to remove it from my report. The lady says she needs to get a supervisor but none are available. Then asks when someone can call me back . I said today asap. And then the lady says remember you can log into your account online to check on your information - but you literally can't and that was part of the reason I called. Literally the worst credit card I've ever had. I wouldn't recommend to anyone. For a company that's supposedly giving credit cards to help build credit it seems highly negligent to not allow the card holder accurate and up to date information on their account and balances. Up to 10 days to post to your account - really!? I recommend people to stay away from this company.",

  "reviewDescription": "This review to express my dissatisfaction, with the customer service provided by Avant Money. My recent experience in trying to pay off a loan has been incredibly frustrating. I feel it's important to share my concerns.\n\nI started the loan repayment process seven weeks ago. Despite my efforts I'm still waiting for a confirmation letter in the mail confirming that the loan has been fully paid off. This delay is not just inconvenient. Also has implications for my mortgage application, which is now being unnecessarily delayed.\n\nI've called Avant Money times over the seven weeks to inquire about the status of the letter. Unfortunately, every time I call they inform me that the letter is \"on its way.\" The lack of a resolution and constant delays in receiving the documentation are causing me a lot of distress and inconvenience.\n\nIn an attempt to escalate this matter I requested a callback, from a manager. To my disappointment they informed me that it would take 48 hours for this process. Unfortunately, I still haven't received any callback yet further prolonging the resolution of this issue and adding to my frustration.\nThe customer service team, at Avant Money is incredibly inefficient and unresponsive which is completely unacceptable. This does not affect my commitments but also specifically impacts my mortgage application.\n\nI strongly urge Avant Money to address this problem and find a solution to the delays in providing the paperwork. This experience has not damaged my perception of Avant Money. Has also raised concerns about the dependability and effectiveness of their customer service procedures.\n\nI sincerely hope that my feedback prompts an examination of your customer service practices ensuring that others do not encounter difficulties, in the future.",

I’m getting offers for the same card now on Credit Karma for 2% cashback, instead of 1% cashback that I’m getting now, and supposedly with a higher credit line that I have now, no annual fee, 2% cashback, but the APR is much higher. I’ve had the card for well over a year have had a few credit line increases, but still think my credit line should be much higher than it is, especially since I see what people are getting as a credit line, compared to what I have now after holding the card and paying my statement balances in full every month for well over a year. Started at $300 and it’s now at $1000 as of the other day. Feel card should have a credit line of at least $1500 - $2000. Plus, I have a great track record with WebBank! Overall it’s a great card and have recommended it to family & friends who now have the card too. Always have had a great experience, just too low of credit line.",

I've had a large balance on all my credit cards which I have been trying desperately to knock down, with little success. I received an offer from AVANT for a personal loan to pay my credit card debt. Although the interest rate is high, it allowed me to pay off all my credit cards and lowered my monthly payments by $400. That gives me much-needed breathing room and I can now pay more than the minimum payment on that loan to pay it off more quickly. All in all, I am very pleased with my association with AVANT.",

  "reviewDescription": "I tried to get a loan from this company. For almost a week, her employees called me at any time they wanted, although I asked to call me at 1pm so that it would not be while I was working in the office. During the call, I can hear almost nothing, since in the background of the conversation of their employee, other conversations and other noises are constantly heard, obviously their company does not know anything about noise reduction. Every day they asked me for more and more information, they even called on Saturday and Sunday. On Sunday during the call, I asked how I could cancel this application, after which the agent still asked questions, she agreed that the additional information she requested was not needed, and said that I would need to check the status of my case in my cabinet and see if it was needed more documents. On Sunday evening I saw that more documents were needed, and on Monday I saw that my application was cancelled. When I called the company and asked why my application was canceled and how to resume it, the agent told me that I canceled my application and if I wanted, I could fill out a new form and that since 7 days had not yet passed, my application would be renewed. When I did this, I received a message that they could not provide me with a loan at this time. Terrible experience with this company!",

Easy to deal with, allows you to set up automatic payments, and the interest rates aren't that bad for low credit scores!! I wish I had found this sooner!! I say \"Great Card\"!!",

Yes the interest rate is a little on the high side but the purpose of the loan is to lower my credit card usage ratio so that my credit score can increase and then I will refinance the loan with a HELOC.

  "reviewTitle": "My 2-Statement, 5-Payment Review - All Good Here!",
  "reviewDescription": "I was approved for $2000 through a Credit Karma offer with their score of about 660. There were different choices at different times, such as 0%, 1%, 2% and 3% back, since I visit that site frequently. When I saw the 3% populate this last time, I registered for their soft-pull on credit, then finalized it shortly after that approval.\n\nThe card arrived promptly and I believe I had some issue activating online, so I used the phone and prompts to do that. I registered my account online and monitor my purchases and payments there. I made multiple purchases nearly immediately at places such as stores and online shopping, even a membership to a social website, as well as my annual phone bill (yep, I pay 1 year in advance); a wide variety of purchases.\n\nIn 2 statements, I’ve made 14 purchases and made 5 payments. I am set up for reoccurring automatic payments, but I don’t wait that long. Once you make a payment, if it is over the minimum due for the month, your reoccurring payment is not deducted, because the system knows you have already made that minimum payment, if the minimum is what you are set up to pay. More simply, it does not double dip if you already paid. If you set it to pay your balance, I need not explain that.\n\nThe only negative I can think of is that they show your purchases and payments as “pending” for at least a day, so you have to do the math yourself to determine your real balance. I’m used to a credit union where transactions are immediate. Pending means you did it, so I don’t get that.\n\nI have not experienced any problems at all with Avant, and I get 3% back. I’m not addressing others’ problems I’ve read about, because I haven’t had those. They email me about my account, when it is due and when I make a payment. I have replaced my debit card with this card, and I just pay it off as I would have done if I had used a debit card. That is why I make so many payments, and I wanted to make sure they take multiple payments, which they do.\n\nSometimes I come home from the store and make a payment for what I just bought. This basically cuts my sales tax nearly in half, as long as I pay it off every month. I make at least one payment a week. I’m used to not having a credit card, so that part is a habit to keep. I'll never raise my score if I carry balances on a card, and neither will you.\n\nDon’t ruin your credit again by using this or any card as a luxury. Don’t buy things you couldn’t otherwise pay cash for. Don't tell yourself, \"It's only $19.95\", just don't. Don’t limit your payments to the minimum; pay the entire balance and get used to it. If you must pay a minimum (I get that), pay more no matter how much more. There’s nothing better than looking at your account online and seeing the balance is $0 with a payment due of nothing.",

  "reviewTitle": "Amazing Loan company!",
  "reviewDescription": "Amazing company! Very fast and reliable. Have used them 2 times and both fully online. I had to pull 1st loan to repair my car. A year later which is now, I applied for more money to consolidate all my debts. Applied on the 5th (thurs) of the month, online, received approval on 6th (Fri) of the month by email, also letting me know I would receive funds on the (Tues) 10th but noticed I received the money in my bank actually on Saturday, the 7th penning, then posted on the 10th. 9th Monday was a holiday. I remember my first loan was pretty fast too. So basically if I didn’t spot over the weekend I’d say from the time you apply it can be 1-4 days. I think my first loan funded by 2nd day and that’s because I had very little debts.\n\nAnyway I was drowning in monthly minimums so this was the best experience because now I just have 1 bill and was able to choose if I wanted long term minimum or short term.\n\nHighly recommend them if you need a loan! Excellent experience. I’ve never had to speak to a customer service rep. I selected autopay and now I’m all set. The 1st bill will be due exactly one month after your fund date, so mine is the 10th every month.\n\nHope this was helpful, I was shopping around before I applied for my second Loan but felt other companies take too long to approve you online.\n\nIf you want a quick turn around which is what I wanted, this company is great!",

  "reviewDescription": "I recently opened an avant card. So far, I hate it in comparison to all of my other cards. After using the card I called to get my bill/payment information to see when my 1st bill would be due, and was told to call back during business hours. I could not obtain payment info or make a payment outside of their business hours. A few weeks later while paying bills, I realized I was now a few days late on my 1st payment.. I immediately made the payment and asked for a 1 time late payment waive explaining the reason. The representative put it the request and told me I would hear back later with a decision. Days later I received an e-mail letting me know the late fee waive was denied and to call a 1-800 number if I had further questions. I called the 1-800 # and the representative said he couldn’t help with any questions concerning this and directed me to email a separate contact. The run around and hassle to even ask a question has been ridiculous compared to any other card I own.",

  "reviewDescription": "After a few years with this company, no past due payments, and finally paying it off, I was cancelled because I was no longer using the card. That caused my Credit Score to drop. The reason I didn't use it was because I live in a city where there is no mail service in the city. Everyone has a PO Box. The first card was sent to that PO Box but the 2nd card never arrived. Now they tell me Avant can't send a card to my PO Box.\n\nUPDATE: There reply is an example of their \"service\". They have my phone number, so they should call. I \"called\" their phone number and was told they couldn't help me. Hence, the review. Now, they want me to call them again... so I can be told the same thing all over.",

  "reviewDescription": "I have been a customer for over a year. I have discovered that this Avant is only concerned with money and does not care one bit about there quality of service or customers. I receive one pay check a month and only asked that my pay date coincide with my pay day. Avant refused to move my pay date. During the almost two years I have been a customer I have NEVER failed to make a payment on time. I only wanted to move my pay date to ensure that funds would be in my account. Avant showed me no Courtesy, Loyalty or Respect. I will close my account and take my business somewhere else.",

Is there any chance you'd call back in? Please call us at 800-712-5407 or write to us at Support@Avant.com. We'd love a chance to fix this situation."

  "reviewDescription": "This is a brand new account. My first payment is due September 25th, 2023. I downloaded the app, set up autopay and scheduled my first payment to post today. After I scheduled the payment a notification came up that said I still need to make my payment due on September 25th. The $300 dollar payment I scheduled today was for my September 25th due date. So I called customer service. AVANT CUSTOMER SERVICE IS A JOKE. I spoke to Auje. It was impossible to make any headway. She just read her printed script no matter what question I ask. She could not provide an answer because she had no clue what she was doing. This is such a reflection on the integrity of a company who has so little regard for the customer that they put little to no effort into ensuring that their employees have the skill set and are equipped with the appropriate knowledge of the product or service they represent to allow them to do their job with even minimal competence. This in no way can be the responsibility of the employee who gets the brunt of our frustration and dissatisfaction, but proof of blatantly self serving leadership. I am the customer. I deserve to be assured of the company's competence, to have trust in and respect for the company I do business with. Mega fail on the part of Avant",

After an hour of phone calls and trying to get a cash advance which will send up costing me more, I finally ended up having my husband call me with one of his credit card numbers to pay.\n\nIt was finally determined that I couldn't use my card because the person I was paying uses the square app for her business.\n\nThat revelation played with the fact that I can't add your card to my Google wallet mean that this card will probably never be used. As soon as I can find another card to replace it, and before I pay any more fees, that's what I'll be canceling this one.",

Called customer service and they told me square transactions are not supported. Plenty of retailers and businesses use square to process payments. I googled and found that lots of others have had issues with where they can use the card. Many reported its very limited. It’s relatively easy to get someone on the phone after your card declines, so i guess thats a good thing but the support speech sounds very scripted and leads me to believe they receive these types of calls often. I wouldnt bother with this card. I wish i knew better before i accepted the offer. Probably going to close this account.",

  "reviewDescription": "Save yourself time and aggravation. My wallet was stolen and it has taken 3 mos with multiple tries to change my address and order a new card. These customer service people ask the same personal information over and over and over and over (just like this) to the point its sickening. Not only do they transfer you to another person it seems no one there is able to think or do any basic brain functions. Lord help you if you ever have to deal with them. Oh and btw they were supposed to charge me $39 a year and now its $59. So not worth it for a $300 credit line with no opportunity to increase your limit. Ughh I should have known better to trust anything from Kredit Kharma....SCAMMMM STAY AWAY!!!!",

  "reviewDescription": "I had a $2000 credit limit. Charged items totaling $1400 and ALWAYS paid on time, never late, and the interest was close to 30%. Returned a couple of expensive items a couple of months after purchase totaling $1100. Overnight my credit limit dropped to $300!! They DID NOT send me an email or anything telling me this. I went to use the card and it was denied by the retailer. Looked at the app to see the limit dropped to $300. Called and they gave no excuse, said I'd receive a letter. When the letter FINALLY arrived it said the reason for the decrease was \"Credit Card Activity\". Apparently, you can't get any refunds without them getting back at you. Since then I quit using the card and paid them off. I will never use that card again! They're not getting $1 interest from me ever again! Avant = Horrible Credit Card! Don't get one.",

They replied saying how sorry they were and asked me to call them because they wanted a chance to make things right. I called them and the rep that answered the line had no knowledge of any reply they had sent to me and went further on to say to just disregard the response, because they don't really intend for people to act on the responses when they reply to reviews left by customers, they just reply so it looks good for the company. I asked for a supervisor and of course, none was available. Again, I say this company is a SCAM. They have a lot of hidden and made up fees and never acknowledge their mistakes. They are lairs and I would not encourage anyone to do business with them. I have also contacted the BBB and the news, so hopefully their unlawful practices will be brought to the light soon and the company will be shut down.",

The fine line between soft and hard credit report inquiries was not obvious nor clear. Had I been offered this option I would have been aware of it.\n\nCuriously enough, I was directed to Avant through Credit Karma and the follow-up emails from CK indicated they were unaware that my 'pre-approval' application was ever completed. There was a disconnect as to whether I had ever initiated an application let alone completed one.\n\nI stand by my original review and believe Avant is aware of the cloudiness of their 'pre-approval' process. It's a shame they feel they need to resort to this type of marketing in order to attract new clients.",

  "reviewDescription": "I set up a payment plan with Avant to catch up on my payments as I have health issues. The plan was selected by the Avant customer service rep. They told me this was what I would have to pay and I would be caught up which I agreed to. I was told my card would stay open and in good standing as well. They also told me there would be interest charges but was not advised that I would also be charged late fees. I was charged for late fees in June, July and August because it was considered late and I didn’t pay enough to cover the past due. How is that when the customer service rep was the one who told me what payment plan would catch me up? I tried calling to get the late fees waived as it was $39/month. The customer service rep was rude and tried yelling at me, was cutting me off and put me on hold for more than 5 mins at a time. Nothing got resolved. I was told they would “file “ a claim for me to get the late fee “refunded” if approved and today I received an email that it was denied.\n\nThis is definitely unlawful practice and as I mentioned I was never once warned about late fees. The dates the payments were automatically withdrawn were the dates an Avant rep picked for me stating it would help me get caught up.\n\nI asked to speak to a manager and not one manager came on the phone.\n\nI’d like to speak to someone who can assist and is professional enough to get these late fees cleared up.",

I don't carry balances, the money I used was in my checking account, therefore I could have used my bank account to pay for the services, that I used the card for. I used the card, because that's what its for. Normally banks report your unpaid balances after both the due date and next statement when you've paid your balance, not the very first statement. If I haven't been given a due date, how can I even pay it.when. You made it seem to credit bureaus I carry a balance, and I don't. This lowered my score 12 points!!! Moral of the story wait til your first statement comes out, and you have a due date, before you use this card for any purchases.",

Then you have to talk to someone who is a racist and hates american people real nice 👍. They lie about you paying you paying your balance in full. They complained that they don’t take responsibility for their employees mistakes and they have to get approval just to remove a fee that they made the mistake of doing. I have paid in full owes training fees and they just accumulate ans this company doesn’t get that it’s the principle not the amount of money which was very insignificant. Thank you very much. I will never recommend a company like yours for anyone not even my worse enemy! Mastercard, capital one all the way .

My problem with Avant is that I overpaid my loan by $325 when I paid the loan off and I still have not received my refund two weeks later. They told me it could take up to three weeks to have the overpayment deposited into my account. I have a hard time believing this when they make deposits daily.\n\n\nUPDATE!!!!!!!\nI did receive an email today from Avant. It was the same thing they have been telling me that I will receive my refund in 2 - 3 weeks. They really should pay what they owe in a reasonable amount of time. You sure can't pay them late.",

I called and spoke to Tom in the fraud department on the 18th of June as was told someone would be in touch during the upcoming week to discuss the charge and start the process of investigating and a refund. We it is now Monday the of the week after I was to be called and still haven't be contacted. I just called again and got customer service who 100% refused to transfer me to the fraud department because no one has yet been assigned my case. So if you are looking for customer service if needed this is definitely not the company for you. I now have to sit here and wait for them to contact me about my fraudulent charge without the option or ability to even ask a question to the department that hopefully will be handling this unfortunate situation!!!!!",

  "reviewDescription": "I was pre-approved for a loan and lady who helped me with my application over the phone was very kind walking me through it. She stated that decisions on pre-approved accounts are instant but it would take at most 24 hours. I am now on day 5 of trying to get this \"pre-approved\" loan done but they keep making me go through hurdles. I presented all bank states, pay stubs, offer letter, and they pulled my credit with a hard inquiry. But they still can't decide if I should have it so I should talk to the IRS about my income being tracked for 2023. This isn't possible by the way but they insisted that I call the IRS now for prove me wrong. Well it's a holiday weekend so no one is available until Tuesday. They proceeded to state that I won't have a decision then until next Friday at the earliest and berated me on the phone about not knowing how this works. Ridiculous waste of a hard credit hit for a loan I cancelled due to their bait & switch tactics.",

  "reviewCompanyResponse": "We're sorry to hear about the misunderstanding. After being shown loan options, but before submitting your application for final review, we require acknowledgement that a hard credit inquiry will be performed. We strive to make our application as clear as possible and apologize that we did not meet your expectations. If you have any additional feedback or questions regarding the application process, please contact us at Feedback@Avant.com."

I used a debt consolidation loan that has not only improved my credit score, but will also allow me to save money by being able to pay off credit cards that had varying interest rates. This means that my loan from Avant will be paid off quicker than balances on my individual credit cards. Definitely recommend!",

I was on the phone for over an hour two times trying to explain my income. The last person I spoke with. I had to go over my benefits with her. I had to read it to her and tell her what page it was on. They want your last bank statement, all the pages even if there blank. Even tho it took me a week everyone was very nice. If they tell you they have everything they need just check back with them to make sure. I'm happy I recived the loan, I payed my car off and a couple credit cards an now I have one manageable payment. Thank you Avant",

Plus I received my money in one business day direct deposit to bank account. I appreciate you all. I would give 10 Stars if I could.\nThank you,\nGlenn Hannon",

Canceled card same day I applied once I discovered this policy. The town I live in ONLY has PO Boxes, no mail is received at home addresses here.

  "reviewDescription": "Avant is a straight up company. I got an alert from credit karma saying I qualified for a personal loan at low interest and I acted on it. I really didn't think too much about it when I submitted my ridiculously simple application on their app... didn't think something so simple would work...I mean...this is a $10,000 unsecured loan we're talking about, but surprisingly the money was in my bank 2 days later...they said 3 days but I got it in 2. All my credit cards are all high interest so I just paid them off with this small loan at 16.99%. My monthly credit card expense was cut by half and my credit score shot right up!! Seriously...you can't beat it with a stick.",

  "reviewDescription": "If I could I would’ve given this Company NO STARS! I applied for a 2000.00 loan through Avant because it was the 1st options out of 3 on Credit Karma with my credit score being Trans 698 and Equ 700 and Exp 689. EVERY!! document that was required was sent in with the help of 1 of the C.Service Rep.. at the end of the day I was told There was NOTHING else needed from me. But check with my Dash board from time to time just in case. I did that. Nothing was asked if me to submit.I would be notify within 24hrs a decision of Approval or denied. Well i had confidence that I would get approved being Credit Karma BASED these Loan Agencies by my Credit score. Well I called the next day for a follow up and spoke to a Khaleel and by the way she spoke to me I KNEW she had it out for me. I hate to say it but I was treated like she didn’t like the color of my skin. So yes you guessed it I was unfortunately not able to receive the funds lol. So you mean to tell me I can get a card through APPLE.. a Bank that’s great but denied through Avant and their bank of choice. WOW! it said that I have 60 days to submit a form asking what was the decision made to Why I was denied. Yes I WANT THAT FORM. I just want to see what was the reason why I was denied. Be careful with this company.AND Credit Karma at this point I think they are running some kind of scam to get ppls information. Glad I pay the extra fraud cost on all my credits cause ppl like AVANT just CAN NOT BE TRUSTED!",

Well, I called the number provided and checked and the Rep. told me I had been approved and told me when the money would be deposited into my account. She didn't not go over the terms of the loan with me, but it was on the information I saw when I applied for the loan. The Rep. was very pleasant, but I just thought they would go over terms with me. The process was very easy and quick, and I really liked that!",

Some cards that I have trusted with doing this, well let's just say that I have been made aware.\nThey posted payments immediately where a couple that I have cut up was waiting until the end of the month. I don't have time for that not when you are trying to rebuild your credit... SO GET AN AVANT CREDIT CARD TO REBUILD YOUR CREDIT AND YOUR SCORE RISE.",

After this point I called Avant customer service i paid my balance in full and requested my account to be closed (here comes the funny part) they Accept my payment in (Full) and after they Cleared the payment , they then proceed to ask me what's the reason I'm closing the account and after I gave them the reason they didn't even make an attempt to waive my annual fee for me to stay, which I wasn't going to but this speaks highly of this company Further more they overcharged me in the process of closing my account and now i must wait 2-3 weeks for their mistake . This company served me as a gateway for a better card American Express last time you will ever hear from me.",

  "reviewTitle": "I would have given a full 5 stars but…",
  "reviewDescription": "I would have given a full 5 stars, but the process for approving my loan took much longer than it should have in my opinion, mainly caused by repetitious steps and a bit of a language barrier! I was asked the same set of questions, and answered the same set of questions three different times over about a week long period! And after each set of questions I was asked, I was led to believe that my funds would be deposited into my bank account either later that day, or by the next day. It happened 3 different times and I was told to expect funds at least by the next day, three different times! It was like starting over each time I called, checking to see what the holdup was? The customer service team was very pleasant, but there was unnecessary aggravation there as well, due to very thick accents from an off-shore customer service team! As I said before, they were very nice, but they are trained to repeat literally every word that a customer says to them, after each sentence. It’s so annoying and makes communication take twice as long, which is an unnecessary waste of time & causes much aggravation! I actually started thinking that they had lost my original loan application or something because I had to verbally reapply every time I called. I almost canceled and went with another bank because of this, but the last time I called , they assured me that I’d be receiving funds by the next morning, which I did, so no harm done. However there was definitely more aggravation than there had to be. I received a fair rate (for 2023) on my unsecured bill consolidation loan considering the interest rates and market conditions of today! Which is of course insanely high, but it is what it is in 2023.",

Prior to the bank closing, I reported a charge to my account that was over a thousand dollars that were not made by me. The bank investigated and closed the case stating they thought I made the charge. I contact the establishment this charge was made and they agreed that since the charge was clearly not made by me that they would like to return the money but would have needed to return it to the account that was used, which was this now closed account. A week later I received an email from Avant stating that they received the money and would be sending me a check in the mail. This was 3 months ago. I call weekly and am told that they don't have a partnership with some other bank and cant send me a check until they have one. I can't believe this! After never even investigating charges I dispute, they are now holding my money. Is this even legal? I am having a hard time paying for my insulin and this bank has over a thousand dollars of my money. How is this possible?",

I've had other cards do that before, but a simple phone call and they realize the problem and remove it. Not this company!

They refused to wave it and I told them that was petty after sending them almost $400 the previous month and that I refuse to pay. The next month they send me a bill for the interest and then a late fee. I just started getting back to fair credit again after a similar fight with BLAZE (which I reviewed here) and they're trashing my score over $7. This company is petty and charges interest even after the account is closed. They could have waved the interest and; thus, not charge me a late fee but they want to ruin people over chump change.",

It’s been 5 and my application has still not been processed despite contacting over FIVE customer service Agents. Each reading some scripted response instead of actually doing their job. Was told repeatedly “we don’t need anything further” “your application is still being looked over”- yet getting daily emails asking for the SAME documents to be sent over and over again. Not only does this company lie and advertise falsely- they’re full of incompetent employees as well. You’d think I was trying to get the money from each representatives pay check the way they’ve basically have refused to help. I have never witness such a dysfunctional loan company! Wouldn’t recommend using them if they were the only people that ever qualified you.

Every attempted transaction is deemed to be FRAUD, when it's not.\n\nOn February 11, I tried to use this card at a place where I am a regular. I was publicly embarrassed to have it declined. So I used another card to pay my tab.\n\nThe next day, I tried to use it at an online delivery app. Declined again. I got an email asking me to call to verify that I made the listed charges. I called, spent forever on hold, and the call got cut off. Called again and finally got the issue solved and my card unfrozen. I thought that was the end of it.\n\nNope. On Monday, February 20, I tried to use it again with the same delivery app. Declined. Tried again at a different retailer to see if maybe the delivery app was the problem, but declined AGAIN. Now they want me to call AGAIN to fix it.\n\nI understand wanting to protect customers from fraud, but this is BEYOND RIDICULOUS. I have to waste hours calling you every time I want to use this card? No. Not gonna happen. Fix the system on your end, don't waste my time making me fix problems that were not my fault. I've been a good customer, always make my payments on time, I don't deserve to be treated like a criminal.\n\nAnd don't bother with your canned response telling me to call again. The answer is NO. How do I know that this won't be the end of it? You have issues on your end, fix it and maybe I will remain a customer. As it is now, i will pay this thing down and then it's good riddance.

  "reviewDescription": "Unauthorized changes to credit card account\nI have had this Avant card for less than a year and without my knowledge or consent, they made the decision to raise the credit limit which 1) had an impact on my credit score and 2) made it appear as if I was shopping for additional credit WHICH I WAS NOT. When I called the company to inquire why I was never notified that the credit limit either was going to be increased or had been increased, the first customer \"service\" representative could only read some scripted answer which did not address the question. Then he transferred me to a RUDE and CONDESCENDING \"supervisor\" who read the same script and hung up on me. I am paying off the $280 I owe these people and never using this card again. They are horrible people to do business with.\n\nResponse to AVANT response: You didn't bother to even read the review. The unauthorized CHANGE (not CHARGE - pay attention) was made to the account with notification either before it took place or after. I found out from a credit bureau. Nowhere in my review did I mention fraud. Nowhere. READ THE ACTUAL REVIEW BEFORE RESPONDING.",

  "reviewDescription": "Reply to Avant : i am sorry as well but i was given a 7.5 % and by email avant said to accept the new interest rate of 26% AFTER Avant done hit my credit report with the 7.5%. Not right to give one interest rate after a credit review then have a much much higher rate before the money was released. Just saying if it happens to anyone else I'd like to know about it.\n\nMoney was deposited quickly, and approval was smooth. After my credit file review I was offered a low rate in the beginning which was the major factor in my decision to take the offer. Once Avant proceeded they stated they was unable to give me the lower rate, that they would offer me a higher interest with apologies. Well they done hit my credit with the first offer so I took what they offered in hopes to move the loan soon.",

After uploading the documents, I received a green boxing stating “completed”. Everyday after I would either receive an email that said “please call AVANT” or upload a document in which I had already upload. This went on for 6 days, each day I would call and speak to different representatives, informing them all that I had completed those task. They would confirm with me that was accurate and told me “we will process your application and approval could can taken place within the same 24hrs.” This was my same scenario every day for 6 days. On day 7, I received an email stating that my application had expired and I would have to re-apply. In disbelief I contacted Avant and the representative pretty much read my email to me, before I could even speak to tell her why I was calling. I informed her I would like to know why they dropped they ball? Why did they send the same emails to me daily with task I had already completed. When I asked for a supervisor, I was told they were on the phone with someone else and the representative would schedule a call back for the supervisor to call me… That call back never happened. Please don’t waste your time with this company, please don’t give them your personal information and then receive a soft or hard pull on your credit. They acted as amateurs or a scamming company. I would’ve gave them zero stars if I could have.",

When I discovered a supposedly unpaid balance as well as two late fees and interest I was angry and disappointed. The 38 minute phonecall didn't resolve anything so now I must wait 48 hours for a supervisor to respond.\nI will keep posting updates here, but I am certain it will be challenging to get a fair resolution.\nAVANT is a horrific company that takes advantage of customers at every opportunity.\nI look forward to never doing business with them again.\n\n1/9/23 no call from Avant and no, I will not call the number they posted on the cut/paste reply just to be left on hold indefinitely.",

This company arbitrarily decides it should lower my credit to $750 from $2k after a “review of my credit”. I called and inquired and customer service they had no reason and that department who makes the decision can’t take calls. Do you believe this?? I close my account right then and there. I had a $427 balance on what was a $2k credit line and now a $750. My debt to loan ratio was killed.\n\nThe next month my credit score drops to 602. This company screwed me over. Fast forward to 5 days before Christmas and I receive this email:\n_______________________________________\n\nWe recently advised you of a credit line decrease on your account that was based in whole or in part on a low behavior score.

I paid it off in full, then I was notified my Credit limit was dropped to $300 for adverse actions on my account??? I called customer service - they were absolutely Useless - they could not help, so I cancelled my card.\n\nI just received and email letting my know that reducing my credit line was an error on their part, but since I cancelled my card with them, there is nothing they can do. It took them 2 months to figure out they screwed up ????\n\nThe worst experience I have ever had with a credit card company. They should never be allowed to deal with finances.\n\nI am sure they will respond and say \" oh we are so sorry, please call customer service and we will help \" - I can assure you, their customer service is 100% USELESS\n\nSTAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY.\n\nUPDATE. As I predicted, Avant responded with the same canned message they use here for everyone who has had a horrible experience. I also did call them back and guess what, they said they cannot help. This company is a joke",

I supplied every document they asked for, some more than once. I carefully explained how each income worked, but everytime I called, I got a different agent and had to explain again. The company did not like that I had 2 different banks and one of my part time jobs paid in paper checks. I can't tell you how many times I was hung up on when I would call to check on my application. They would NOT accept the second job as a second income without being able to prove where I deposited the checks. My credit is fair but trending upward, every payment on time and remarks are all postiive on my credit report. Isn't the point of applying for a consolidation personal loan to consider what the clients are trying to do...get out of debt with the least amount of interest charges and lowering your DTI?! Just say no, and go elsewhere.",

This was kind of funny considering the fraudulent activity was less than couple hundred overall.\n\nMakes no sense rt? This company overall has no heart or any level of intelligence. Unfortunately the future is a bunch of robots.\n\nThey wouldn’t remove one late fee when I had Covid. They make it a priority to protect themselves over prioritizing customer service.\n\nThis is just my experience with the company. They’re rude and very unfriendly. Go with American Express 💯",

  "reviewTitle": "SCAM",
  "reviewDescription": "SCAM! FRAUD! I paid my account in full on 10/4/22. Payment Posted in my bank account 10/5/22. Avant received the payment and it posted, the account was closed down 10/6/22. Avant sent me an email confirming the account was closed down at my request. Without my knowledge! Avant did not close my account and on 10/17/22. Avant charged me $11.06 in interest on a account that was closed down on 10/6/22 on a $0 balance. Avant did not report my account closed until 10/20/22. Thinking this was an error! I contact Avant and had to deal with the most incompetent, uneducated, rude, lack of empathy, and disrespectful employees in my life! I got hung up on multiple times! The Supervisor Shaniece hung up on us was stand offish forgetting her ghetto attitude is not allowed at a place of business. My wife and I got hung up on multiple times by majorityof the time! I was advise it will take the company 14 days to respond to my complaint and it will be by email. The payment is due in 8 days on account that shouldn't exist. This payment they want it not much but it's the principally of them forcing and bullying me into paying, I believe because I closed my account. The reason I closed my account is because i felt the company was the weakest link amongst all my credit cards and before this i had 3 other horrible interactions which lead to me closing my account, the right way, paying my balance in full. I would highly recommend using another company for your financial needs. They claim all these calls are recorded so they can pull up them to confirm everything I've mentioned here!\n\n\nUpdate: 11/15/2022\nAvants response is an automated response! If Avant checked their records! They'd see i already did that multiple times and got a bullsh!t response supporting their decision. Their response below is to satisfy the person reading the review to assume Avant is on top of their customer complaints. They did nothing and told me they will do nothing! I was forced to pay their fraud charges or it would impact my credit score and my \"never missed a payment\". Do business with someone else to avoid my situation.",

They set me up with a $3000 limit in August and because I don’t use the account often I received a letter stating that my limit was dropped to $300. The only reason why I got it was for my total available credit to increase. I am below 20% but wanted it lower since I am trying to buy a house. They also pulled my credit again without my permission. I closed my account and will be filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau. Save your time and don’t apply with them.",

I logged in today and not only did they take my 2800 payment, they immediately decreased my line to 300. I sold a beloved family possession to pay this off and now I'm heartbroken that I seemed to have done it for no reason. They refuse to tell me why and only said \"you'll receive a letter\". Absolutely terrible that they can do this on a whim, especially to customers who never miss payments. This will end up decreasing my credit score to a point that I'll not be eligible for my home loan now and we are likely going to end up in the streets soon. I'll be immediately closing this account.

  "reviewDescription": "I opened up a card account with Avant and started with a $1,500 credit limit. I used it for travel and car rental. My last trip I used $1,400 of my available credit and when I returned home I paid the balance in full before the statement period ended. As, I was preparing for my most recent trip. I attempted to use my card to reserve a car and that's when I learned my available credit had been decreased to $300 with no notice or justification. I've NEVER been late or missed a payment.\nSo, there was no reason for the decrease or the embarrassment that I was put through. I see from other comments, this is a normal practice of AVANT. This company is a fraud and misleading when having you apply. DO NOT APPLY for a card with them. When they do this it DIRECTLY IMPACTS your credit negatively!!! I'll certainly close my account and stop doing business with this unethical company. I'll also contact the BBB and the states Attorney Generals office. I encourage those with similar experiences to do the same.",

I looked at my account and they lowered my limit substantially. No one ever told me anything. Then I call \"customer service\" after 10 minutes on phone the guy said he couldn't help me and for me to email customer service. I emailed customer service and they told me by their records it was handled over the phone. No communication at all!! I am paying off my account and closing it. They are horrible. They want me to call or email to resolve this issue. I tried that originally and got no where. They do NOT communicate with people. The phone people say one thing and the email say something completely different. Waste of time",

Yesterday I logged on to make a payment only to discover they had dropped my credit limit from 1500 to 300. That is INSANE. If anything I should have been given an increase for ALWAYS using my credit responsibly and NEVER being late. They've actually just hurt my credit with their actions. Pretty sad to do that to someone who has been a responsible user and never been late in payments. I closed my account which is also going to hurt my credit, but I guess it's better than being involved with a company that has no values. Good riddance.",

  "reviewDescription": "When I applied for the card they advertised and told me that my credit line would be Dubbed when I payed the first 6 payments did not happen. When I called to ask about it I was told they would have to check my credit to see if they could increase it instead they cut my credit limit in half and I made my payment and they refunded it. Don’t know what I’m talking about they did not refund my payment. Also when I make a payment on auto bill pay it takes them 3 week to post payment and try to charge late payment fee. Tried to talk to a supervisor told no and hung up on me. There web page advertisement personalized service. Beware",

  "reviewDescription": "I would give negative stars if I could. This card has TERRIBLE customer service. They sent an email offering help to those of us hit by Hurricane Ian, in the form of no late fees. I called to confirm this and ask to skip the payment for October, to which the agent said I could. I skip the payment and am immediately inundated with late payment emails. I call again and the first person I spoke to told me I hadn’t made my August payment and that was why I was getting the emails. I made two payments in July, one on the first for July and one on the 29th for August. Then, when I got a supervisor on the phone, he told me my September AND October payments were late and I told him I was looking at my statements and September was paid on the 3rd. He refused to uphold what the agent that had told me about being able to skip the payment. Thanks for not assessing late fees, but no thanks for the late payment mark on my credit score. I will pay this garbage card off as soon as I can and get rid of it. Stay away from Avant!!",

Made a very big mistake by applying for this card just know that in a time of need or natural disaster they will not help you as they will tell you that it goes against company policy to help you out with any late fees as such Due to not being able to pay credit card payment. For example, I work outside I live in South Florida, and was affected by hurricane Ian due to the amount of rain that it left behind. I asked for a late fee waiver due to me, not being able to work because of all the rain and it was denied due to company policy , not due to being a committed customer. Very bad company. I understand that most people will write good reviews, but it’s only because they were not faced with certain situations as others, like myself. I asked to speak with a supervisor in which they can only repeat what the associate would say naturally. The supervisors are no help. They’re just there to repeat policy “” they also did not leave a reference number for me so they can reply to me directly, they do not care about their customers they care only for the money, which I believe is a robbery.",

First, I've never had a company block funds because of a late payment by a day, but the facts are that payment was made on time and not late. They can see it in their system as pending and won't unblock until it posts, which we all know takes a couple of business days. So the majority of their customers would have to be having their funds blocked for payments they make on time, on their due date, while their payments are in pending. I even explained I'm visiting my dying dad in ICU and needed a hotel and they refused to do anything even though they can see my payment was made on time. Then, I was told that my payment would go through at the end of the day 9/26 and unblocked for 9/27. I called back 9/27 and it's still blocked, with the agent telling me it's still in pending even though I can see payment posted with a thank you note. I will never ever use this company again and am paying it off and recommend no one else use them. This policy of theirs was not in the terms and conditions when applying for credit.\n\nEdit to reply to Avant's reply: Why would I waste more time calling you when I've called three times and even spoke to a supervisor? My dad is dying, I don't need to waste my time with a company like you who didn't try to make it right several times.",

  "reviewDescription": "Edit 9/30/22 - Avant announced via email that all Avant deposit accounts would be closed by 11/30/22 due to their partnership with Evolve B&T ending. Avant launched their deposit account product in December of 2021, so this product will have existed for less than a year by the time it shuts down. So much for helping underserved people huh? Shutting their bank account down after 9 months.\n\nI will leave the rest of my original review untouched, but this review was written before the shutdown notice was released to any individual customer.\n\nAvant sucks. Never forget that.\n\n\n\nI would never ever recommend Avant bank to anyone. Not in a million years.\n\nFirst off, they trick you into opening an account. Like many of you, I was looking for a credit card for those with low credit scores looking to rebuild their credit. I came across the Avant card and applied for it. After applying, I wasn’t actually told if I was approved or not, I was just told “thanks for applying. We have something else that might help you.” I actually didn’t realize this was for a checking account, but wanting the credit card I continued. Then I see I was denied the credit card. So what the heck did I just open? A checking account. Cool, so now I’m stuck with this checking account I don’t really want, but if there’s a chance they can help me achieve a healthier financial life, I thought why not. Moved all my money over, all my bill payments, all my direct deposit, and closed my old checking account. Avant was my future for banking, I guess.\n\nThat was just over 2 months ago. Now, about 9 total weeks after opening the account, I’ve closed my Avant checking account and want to warn everyone who might read this to stay the heck away from them.\n\nContinuing with their flaws, this is an anemic checking account. I haven’t been able to confirm whether or not they actually use Chexsystems, but I would assume they don’t; in that case, there’s literally no reason to open this account unless for some reason you’re not able to open one with Chime or SoFi, two other non-Chexsystems fintech companies that offer completely free feature-rich checking AND savings accounts. Avant deposit accounts are checking-only (no savings account offering whatsoever) with no APY, no Zelle, no checks, no check deposit (mobile or physical), no cash deposit, no physical locations, no peer-2-peer payment system whatsoever, no dedicated bill pay, a really bad ATM system (not even AllPoint offering), and most importantly, really bad account limits. They also code transactions like Cash App and Apple Cash as “ATM withdrawals,” which means that you can kiss goodbye any chance of using your Avant account to pay rent (since there are no checks either), as their ATM limits are hard-capped at $310 unless you’ve been their customer for over a year.\n\nNext, let’s talk about their support. It basically doesn’t exist. They’re a bank that uses a ticket-based customer support system, which should already be a red flag for most people. If it isn’t, I should tell you now that despite this ticket-based support system, customer support will still go out of their way to waste your time. I was trying to close my account and was asked to give a reason why, as well as to confirm with the last 4 of my SSN and my DOB. I gave them the last 4 and my DOB, and they came back hours later with a copy-paste of the same message asking for a reason why I’m closing my account. Yes, they make you wait hours for a response but will still pester you for your opinion. Instead of just being a decent customer service representative and processing my request, they had to waste my time one last time before I ceased being their customer. Fantastic job. The most ironic thing was them telling me “here are some reasons you might wanna rethink your decision.” If there was any chance of me rethinking my decision, it was erased the moment you proved that you have NO respect whatsoever for my time. Aside from that, they have a phone number that you can call that isn’t 24/7 (no 24 hour line whatsoever), and that’s it. And just as the icing on the cake, Google is pretty much useless if you have this account; all Google results are tailored to their credit card, so whenever you search “Avant” or “Avant checking” with your problem, the ONLY results you’ll receive will either be insanely basic or won’t be relevant because they’ll be tailored towards another product. So in my mind, this bank account has no value if you value customer support at all.\n\nAll in all, Avant’s checking/deposit account is just kinda pointless. An anemic account with no features, you’d be far better off with a local credit union or something like SoFi or Chime. With no customer support to back it up, this account is completely pointless and I recommend you look elsewhere if you care about your money.\n\nThanks for reading!",

Everything I sent lined up with my application. They requested these documents over the course of a week. When you call you will get zero help- I mean ZERO help.\n\nI tried emailing and my email was not responded to for three days. When it was to was of Zeto help.\n\nWhen you go to their dashboard to check the status or see what's going on.. all it says is you have things to do and your application is going to expire. But when you call them about it- they say there is nothing you need to do and nothing to turn in continue checking your dashboard, but you do and it says it is about to expire, and yet you need to do nothing. If it expires they have you reapply which is another hard inquiry on your credit report.\n\nI have never written a review before but was so mad about this process I had to share my experience.\n\nI'm sure this company and loan program are and have been wonderful options for many.

If you deal with this company you are not moving forward,you are moving backwards while they are moving forward with your money please don’t do it just work hard and pay your stuff off like I should’ve did. I work very hard for my money I guess I should’ve just been a little more patient in paying stuff off, because in the end that’s the way the situation would’ve paid off the best.

I really like the fact that you can make the payments with your debit card from your bank account which automatically debits the payment from your bank account instead of waiting the 3 days for the bank payment to clear. The Interest rate is low and after making consistent payments you are able to receive a credit increase. The website is also very easy to navigate through. I highly recommend this card.",

  "reviewDescription": "RIDICULOUS HOOPS to jump through\n\nA scammer opened an account in my name through Avant, because they make the process super easy for scammers, and tried to get funds. Those funds were denied apparently. But these are the hoops Avant wants people to jump through for them to acknowledge scammers hurting YOUR CREDIT through THEIR COMPANY PRACTICES.\n\nDon't do business with them. The reviews from customers make it clear Avant will WASTE HOURS of your time to clear up any issues you run into with them.\n\nEMAIL RECEIVED FROM AVANT:\n\nThank you for contacting Avant. Your account has been forwarded to us because you have indicated that you do not believe you applied for credit from Avant. Avant has been able to locate an account in your name. It is important to note that the application in question has not been funded. However, an inquiry may have been initiated by Avant into your credit profile. Inquiries can affect your credit score and are visible to third parties viewing your credit report. If you still believe you have not applied for credit from Avant, please take the following steps:\n\n1. Print and complete the attached “Identity Theft Victim’s Complaint and Affidavit” (“Affidavit”). The Affidavit must explicitly mention Avant in order to be accepted. You must have the Affidavit (item 22 on page H-6) witnessed by a Notary Public. If you elect not to complete the attached Affidavit, you must file a Law Enforcement Report, described in item 20 on page H-5 of the Affidavit, or an IC3 referral form. The law enforcement Report or IC3 referral form must explicitly reference Avant in order to be accepted. Filing a false Law Enforcement Report may result in criminal prosecution with penalties up to a felony conviction.\n\n2. Deliver the Affidavit, Law Enforcement Report or IC3 referral form and any other supporting evidence of identity theft you may have, to Avant via email, fax or mail.",

  "reviewDescription": "I thought this was a good idea...but no. I applied for an received an Avant card. The very first time I used it, it was declined. When I called, the rep said their systems were down. So I asked where could I go to find out if they were having issues like that before I tried to use it. The answer: No where. Good luck.\nThen, when I was able to use it, and went online to pay the bill, I called and asked when would my payment be posted to my account. They said within one day. BUT it would not be considered available credit for 10-15 days. So really you really only have access to the the available credit on the card about 15 days out of the month? Why is it Capital One and Chase can post a payment the day you pay them and Avant needs 15 days. Paid off the card and stuck it in a drawer. Useless.\n\nUPDATE: So I reached out to Avant like their response said and asked how they were going to \"fix the situation.\" And their response was no response. The reply said to email them. And then when I did, they said I had to call. Guess what will happen when I call? This company posts responses to these reviews as a way to seem like they are listening. They are not. Clearly. #reallybadmarketing",

I full intend to reach out to their corporate offices due to this terrible experience. I spent over 3 hours in the last 3 days trying to get an answer and all I got was the runaround. I don't know what changes have been made to their personnel over the last 2 years, but it is terrible. I would not recommend Avant to anyone.",

  "reviewDescription": "Despite my having paid-in-full three prior Avant loans, never one day late on a payment, and charging an annual interest rate in excess of 30%, Avant still wants to do a debt to income analysis. I supplied bank statements which show deposits. Not enough for Avant. If I wanted to go through the bother of submitting two years tax returns, I'd go to a conventional lender who charges a much lower rate. That's where I'm headed. So much for convenience.",

After calling them the next day they told me that I DO NOT HAVE AN ACCOUNT with them and they could not even tell me exactly where they got my full name and email address from. This Makes me wonder if they are opening customer loan accounts just like Wells Fargo and US Bank were doing until they got caught by the FEDS. If you notice over 90% of the positive reviews are from people they invited to leave a review. Then they messed up and sent invites to people that they should not have and boom! This just shows how messed up this company is they send invites to people that will give them positive reviews. I tried clicking on the link they sent me but it was disabled even after I called them and they assured me that the link still worked even though I was going to rate them horribly. I have a feeling this is the same for everyone else that got these fraudulent review invites. DO NOT DO BUSINESS with a company that is willing to make up reviews! They do it because they are crooked.",

  "reviewDescription": "UPDATE: to my surprise, I just checked my account and saw that all fraudulent charges were refunded plus the interest charges for each. I have increased my rating to 3 stars as I didn’t have to call again or hound them to credit my account. Still some red flags though about their data security though that I can’t ignore, and the fraud department process was very odd. I also just received an email yesterday that I was declined for a credit card however I did not apply for a second one so I’m not sure what that’s about….\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\nI have to assume that 90% of their 5 star reviews must be fake because Avant either has some serious security/data issues OR they are the issue. I’m leaning towards the latter. Since I was first approved for my Avant card I’ve been having some serious issues with mass spam emails and fraudulent activity.\n\nI had 7 fraudulent charges on my Avant card last month and my attempts to rectify the issue has shown Avants true colors and I completely question their legitimacy. I don’t believe they have any actual employees and I really question whether companies like this are really the problem, rather than the “ghost hackers” out there stealing data. If I could go back in time, I absolutely would not have disclosed any of my information to this company. Period.",

  "reviewDescription": "I have meant to cancel this credit card for 5+ years now and just hadn’t. When the widespread compromise occurred, I received no notification, no information for weeks after I realized it happened. When I initially called they were reassuring, it would be fixed in a timely matter and not reported to the credit bureaus. That was a lie. Do I care that a measly $500 was reported? Not particularly. I do care, however, that they were misleading, or at the very best misinformed and obviously unable to handle such a compromise. To add to that, the second time I called customer service to inquire as to why it had not been resolved in all this time and had been reported despite their convincing reassurance it would not be, the customer service representative used phrases like “as I was saying before you interrupted me” and ultimately hung up on me. Your job is customer service, customer service in a financial institution at that, expect people to be upset when their money is compromised and learn to fix the issue rather than escalating it. I can’t comment on anything other than that. However, fraudulent charges occurring in the first place, the time is took to resolve, and the absolute lack of professionalism from customer service makes this company an absolute no go from me.",

I would not recommend doing business with this company They don’t do direct lending they send it to other companies to apply for the loan in our experience it was not worth it. very stressful resubmitted document over and over and very little communication between the customers and customer service instead of updating us with what was really happening they were letting our application expire and not getting back to us .

Then, should you reset your password, they ask for your SSN and date of birth, as the SSN allows them to claim you, and birth dates from data brokers may not be reliable.\n\nDo not give them this information! Set a unique/secure password, then exit out of the process. Pull a full credit report to ensure no one has signed up with an account under your name.\n\nI called their support.

  "reviewDescription": "I recv'd this email requesting that I write a review OF THIS 'company' on TrustPilot. Usually, I'm very astute w/who I conduct business with. However, I haven't ever had any correspondence w/this company, so any review relating to their \"'quality' of service\" would admittedly, lack credibility and be based on falsehood.\n\nI've done consumer advocacy work for over 20 years now, and have written many reviews on several sites. Typically, a legit company doesn't solicit or request that customers review them. That's almost wholly initiated voluntarily. But Avant admittedly caters to low credit score applicants in their issuing of Secured Credit Cards.\n\nHowever, given that my score is actually exceptional, I'd have absolutely NO USE for their services. My guess, quite frankly, is that they're soliciting Shadow Reviews from unsuspecting applicants in order to bolster their image. Well they've met their match here!!!\n\nSuffice it to say though, not having EVER done business with them B4, doesn't otherwise prevent me from suggesting or stating that I feel that this 'company' is employing a questionable business tactic in their quest to bolster their image for added recognition.\n\nIf, however, they reach out to me and can substantiate my actually contacting them, then clearly I'd reconsider this posting, based on what I then learn, and modify this review! My guess though...that'll never happen.\n\nUntil then, \"Avant\" seems a bit SCANT to me!!!\n\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\nMy response to their \"Blow-off\":\nBelow this supplement, you'll see what, in effect, is a tacit denial and an outright failure to take responsibility for their predatory marketing practices rather to instead, do what's right and own up to their engagement in these bogus marketing practices that prey on less aware individuals!

  "reviewDescription": "REFERENCE #279999\nSo to start, I have to say that for me having a poor credit rating, they gave me that chance to build myself back up again and even trusted me for a $1500 credit limit to start. Now who ever developed the App is really bad at their job and needs to step down. 1st- it doesn't track your spending with exact change, it rounds it self up to the next dollar so when you get close to your limit, you end up hitting it $15 early. So a few weeks ago I went out of town and ended up using $980. So that should leave me with $520. I'm at home and trying to buy an item online from a timed auction and win. I put in my card numbers to pay and it kept saying declined. It cant be cause of no credit so I don't understand what's going on. I call them up to be told that they're having technical problems and all accounts were frozen. Needless to say, I lost the item and couldn't even use my remaining credit for a full 2 months. I was told as soon as it's fixed that I would receive a email but that never happened. I just randomly discovered it on my own, just past the 2 month mark. What's funny is that they could still do statements, collect your payments for sure and create new Ads to get you to make extra payments to get ahead.\nSo this month (August) I made an attempt to make 2 early payments and then my monthly payment. The app gave me alot of trouble taking my new card# from my Square account but finally got it, or maybe not. My 2 $50 payments and my $100 one got canceled. Now once I realized it, it's past the due date and I get hit with a $25 late fee. I didn't receive a single email for any of the payment problems, no text, or nothing in my app portal. This is horrible and a super sloppy way to run a financial institution. Stay away and Don't Say That I Didn't Warn You!!!!!",

The website login working is 50/50. No credit limit increases in well over two years (my score is now significantly higher). It will help raise your score but a secured card with decent rates and customer service would be a better option. Also you can’t transfer your balance away and close the card. I had a promo of zero percent interest if I transferred my balances over to Barclay, avant refuses to transfer it.",

So I rarely even use this card because it’s always some kind of production. So I wish they would get there system working properly and know off this nonsense!

The check recently showed up on my dashboard as having been received four days prior . . . and four days after I was told that I should just cancel the check because there was no record of it. I paid off a few different cards around the same time, and this was, without a doubt, the most frustrating customer service experience.",

C.S is horrible. I pay my bill on time, at least 12 days before the due date and I pay an extra $15.00 on top of my monthly fee. they denied me for an increase which is probably good because I just can't anymore with Avant.

How from 12/2020 to 8/22 a 3800 loan, I have a balance of 2200??? It makes no sense. The approval process for a loan is pretty easy and simple. Once approved getting the funds, *oh and it wasn't the full 3800 because they deducted a few hundred for the application and administrative fee is what I was informed by customer service* were fairly easy and simple.

Both were very polite and I really appreciated their help in completing the application process.\n\nI would definitely recomment Avant.",

  "reviewDescription": "I applied for a loan for $10,500 with them a week ago. The process was ridiculous. They will NOT email you when you need to update anything, and they will not call. You will have to keep checking your application if it needs to be updated. I applied last Wednesday night, about 4pm. I called on Friday to check the status and they kept speaking quick and he said he needed to submit it for review and is there anything else he could help me with, he tried to get me to hang up, but I stayed on the line. 20 minutes later he comes back and asks why my paystub comes from a different company and not mine, I had to explain this to him. After that, another THREE days they sent me an email to call them, and they told me my paystub bank account did not match the bank account I gave them. It was completely false, I literally had to walk them through the difference between a routing number and an account number. This took AN HOUR. Also they don't speak clear english. Finally resolving it they took another day to post I need to verify other income to get to the right Net income, which was not correct because my net income was already OVER what they pre-approved me with. I think it was just stalling at this point because I submitted my husbands checks asap and they let it sit again without updating it. Then today I get an email that my loan application EXPIRED, and I would have to reapply. I have NO interest in getting a loan through this company anymore. I think they just collect your information for fraud reasons and then go about their day. No sense of urgency with them. You will not get a loan approved before it expires. Every review I have read that seems real, they all have the SAME issues.\n\nUPDATE: I will not be giving them a second chance. I secured a different loan on better terms from Prosper in 24 hours.",

  "reviewDescription": "I am a previous customer with Avant. They gave me a personal loan when I was really financially stressed. I was able to pay off the loan 2 years in advance. After several months, they started sending me emails to apply for another loan. I finally did on 7/20/22. Unlike the first experience, this one was a nightmare. They kept asking for the same documents over and over. Each time I submitted the documents, they would say I didn’t need to do anything else, but they would never say whether or not the loan was approved. Finally after 7 days, I received an email saying my application had expired and I could re-apply! So I did on 7/28/22. I got the same run around with the document requests but no follow-up from Avant. After a couple days, I just told them to cancel my application. I was frustrated. Not because I didn’t get the loan, but because they weren’t professional enough to let me know one way or another. I felt like just another piece of paper, rather than a person. If that’s the way they treat people, I’m glad I don’t have to do business with them. Oh, by the way, before I paid off the previous loan, I paid every payment on time.\n\nHelen R. Richmond",

I complied because of the importance of this loan. Yes i was eventually approved but it was apparent that there wad a lack of communication between Avant representatives. I was getting frustrated having to explain and reexplain my situation. I also feel that consumers needing a loan should be reminded that they only have 7 days to submit.

  "reviewDescription": "I was given a very decent interest on my loan back then. My credit wasn't the best then. I had autopay set up. I made every payment in full & on time. They applied every payment correctly without any issues. Anytime I went online or on the app to just give everything a look everything worked perfectly. They were both easy to navigate and understand. I have nothing but good things to say about Avant.",
